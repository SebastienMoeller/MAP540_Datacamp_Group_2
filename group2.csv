"Influenster" "I was pretty excited to get the phone, but was also hesitant. I was going from a 6S to the X and was worried that it may be too much of a big change for me to get used to with it having no home button.
After having the phone now for over a week, I am happy to say that I have been having a great experience with it so far. I had very little issues with switching to it. No problem at all with Face ID.
The only thing I am not really a fan of is changing to app view and closing the apps out. I find it to be a bit of a time waster compared to how it was with a home button.
One of my favourite features is the camera. I am really liking the quality of the photos, especially those that are taken in Portrait mode.
I am very happy with this phone."
"Influenster" "I would love to receive an iPhone X. I have tried this product out at my closest Apple store and it is amazing.The screen feels absolutely smooth. Lack of a headphone jack sucks but if you buy it it comes with wireless EarPods and a dongle.This is my #GiftCrush."

"Influenster" "Wow, this phone is amazing. It took me a day to get use to the phone. I had to watch the tutorial online and it helped a lot. This phone is expensive though but to me it’s worth the money."
"Influenster" "I don't see the problem with the iPhone x. It has an amazing face ID sensor which saves time. It is almost the same as the iPhone 8:/ very pricey. Great camera quality"

"Influenster" "I’m seriously crushing on the new Apple iPhone X.
I would LOVE to get one of these from Santa this year but I think I might be on his naughty list 😝
With its Face ID and voice recognition, it’s faster and smarter than it’s predecessors. You can also send an Animoji of yourself in messages, can’t wait to play with that function.....
Edge to edge, corner to corner screen makes it so very appealing to the eye........
Wireless charging would make life so much simpler, no more being tied to the wall........
And with all that screen, you’d expect nothing less than it being dust and water resistant. Which means good things for those miserable English days and nights and when it simply won’t stop raining!!
My crush on the iPhone X is because of all the above reasons, who wouldn’t want a phone that can pretty much do everything?!
Having one of these would make writing reviews and taking pictures and shooting videos so much more of an enjoyable experience.
I enjoy what I do now but feel like I’m only in little league on my current phone."

I had the 7plus before this one so in getting use to the smaller size, however the screen is much longer so it doesn’t feel like such a big difference to me. Facial recognition works!

Best camera made ever in a smartphone.

Cons:
Expensive"
"Amazon" "Everyone reading this is probably familiar with the Apple phone line up so I am going to focus on the differences between the iPhone X and iPhone 7 plus specifically.First off, the set-up process has been significantly streamlined. When setting up your new iPhone X setup will ask you if your old iPhone is nearby, select yes, and you can wireless transfer all your apps, settings, backgrounds, passwords, etc. to your new phone in a few clicks. I really appreciated this streamlined process and it was incredibly quick and easy to transfer all my settings to my new iPhone X.The other main features that have been upgraded are as follows:New screen (5.8” OLED is the most vibrant and clear screen ever produced by Apple)- Apple has removed the touch ID sensor and bezel around the old iPhone screen which means the iPhone X has a noticeably smaller footprint while maintaining a larger screen size than the iPhone 7/8 Plus. (See comparison images attached of the iPhone X versus iPhone 7 Plus).- OLED Screen offers deeper blacks and brighter whites resulting in greater color reproduction.- Similar to the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus the iPhone X uses true tone technology to mimic the lighting conditions around it and adjust the white balance accordingly.- The notch cut out of the top of the screen is where Apple has included the face recognition sensors, front camera, and a host of other sensors. I thought this would be annoying but Apple has cleverly used the screen real estate on both sides to include the time, date, battery indicators, etc.Farewell Touch-ID, Hello Face-ID- Face-ID is Apples new facial recognition technology which has replaced the finger printer reader and home button in order to free up additional screen real-estate. This is new and only available on the iPhone X.- Apples facial recognition is light years ahead of Samsung or any other carrier. I have tested this flawlessly with glasses, a hat, and even in the dark. It is as simple as looking at your phone and swiping up from the bottom.- I was worried this feature would be inconsistent or frustrating but it has worked really well. The only time it is a bit more inconvenient is if the phone is sitting on your desk or a flat surface you kind of have to lean over a bit or angle the phone towards you to unlock it.- This super powerful new camera also enables the animoji features which maps your facial expressions to create a talking emoji. This is a fun feature but more a novelty than anything.- This same true-depth camera makes the iPhone X the ultimate phone for taking selfies. The new portrait mode allows the user blur the background, or even cut yourself out entirely and place yourself on a black background.Additional noteworthy features and changes:- The rear camera boasts a dual 12MP sensor array with improved aperture and wide angle lens with image stabilization. The increased aperture from 2.8 to 2.4 allows for better images in low light conditions.- Video capabilities have also approved as well to include 60p 4k video recording delivering clear, fluid images.- Increased audio quality and volume- Increased RAM size to 3GB and new Bionic Chip makes the iPhone X one of the most powerful smartphones are the market.- Updated design features glass back and sides which make the phone beautiful looking. A very welcome change in the normal design.- Battery life: The iPhone X boasts the largest battery in Apple history with a 2716 mAh battery which is a bit larger than the new iPhone 8 Plus. A full charge from 0-100% takes about 2 hours and 10 minutes in my testing.- In addition, wireless charging has finally been added to the new iPhone X, and 8 series phones. I have not tested this out but am excited to give it a try (Wireless charging pad is not included with the phone).Bottom line, the iPhone X is another smash hit from Apple. Every feature people were concerned about turned out to work flawlessly as usual. I have only had the iPhone for about 24 hours so it is early to leave a long-term focused review but so far the new iPhone X has lived up to the hype. The iPhone X may not revolutionize the smart phone industry but it is a welcome upgrade to the iPhone which designs were getting a bit dated. I am excited about Apples new strategy to release a flagship model and allow the new features to trickle down to next generation’s phones.If you have the money to spare you won’t likely be disappointed. My only complaint is the phone only comes in 64GB or 256GB basically forcing users to pay an extra $150 to get decent storage. Further, the beautiful glass back on the screen feels fantastic and has a great weight to it. However, a replacement screen will cost you $275+ and the back glass replacement is rumored to cost around $400. Essentially a single drop could result in a $700 repair bill. Unfortunately this means most phones will be shielded in a case and will not be enjoyed.Read less***Note Carrier Compatibility:All carrier variant iPhone X in the world are carrier unlocked.

"Amazon" "Fine"
"Amazon" "Good"
"Amazon" "nice phone buy too expesive , its the same like the other iphones just with the different display"
"Amazon" "On time and exactly as described."
"Amazon" "I am surprised to see such a high price on this phone. Not sure why people would over pay. My brothers and I began buying and upgraded to the latest iPhone since the very first version and the iPhone X is one the the biggest changes that I can remember. Much like going from the iPhone 3GS to the 4 was or the iPhone 5 to the 6.The X model looses the Home Button and doesn’t have a the headphone jack like the 7’s. No big deal on the headphone jack. Sometimes I do prefer plugging a set in and not having to worry about Bluetooth.The lack of a Home button does take some time getting use too. It is really different with the swipe gestures but after a day or so you get use to it. Basically learning a new way to switch and X out of apps. I like it now after using it.The phone is fast, feels crisper than the 7. Safari is snappier and pretty much all the apps are.The phones size is somewhat like the 7, feels thinner but is a tad larger.If you can afford it, you will be happy. I played with the iPhone 8 and it feels quicker too.The Face ID works really well. Being brothers that look a lot alike we try to trick it but it doesn’t work. This is the first of what will be new technologies for Apple like the Face ID, this was probably rushed and the next version will be more secure and work better. But it seems to work fine right now and does take the place of the finger ID pretty well.Camera takes awesome pictures.The 256g model can hold a lot of data which is nice and since your spending a grand you might as well spend the extra money and get the extra memoryPleased so far and looks like a solid reliable phone. In all fairness though, I could get by just fine with the iPhone 7 that I have been using. The main thing I like is the larger screen which is gorgeous and the faster processor. I love the phone but honestly I could have waited a year for the next model. If you can afford it now you’ll enjoy it. The size is perfect for me and the screen is awesome.Get a good case to protect it with which also hide the gorgeous design. I never really saw the iPhone 7 in black that I had because I always had it in a heavy duty case to protect it. It’s a shame to hide such great looking devices but you kinda have to so they don’t get dinged up."
"Amazon" "This is a cross-post review from the unlocked version, but given they are the exact same phone, I thought it would be good to post:I received my X on launch day and I absolutely love this phone. If you would like a list of just my thoughts on the phone, scroll down to the bullet point list.The transition:NO home button! The staple of the iPhone is gone; well, moved to a little notch at the top. I was expecting this transition to  a home-button-less iPhone to be difficult, but all of the gestures feel so natural. I find myself annoyed trying to utilized an older iPhone as the interface now feels clunky. Switching through apps, opening the phone, accessing everything, it's all so easy. Now, this isn't to say there isn't a transition and while everything feels natural, there is a period of time where you have to get used to the new interface and some aspects that initially seemed difficult become second nature. For example, reachability was a favorite feature of mine and while it was initially hard to activate, I have now learned how to activate it without an issue (reachability brings the iPhone screen down halfway to reach top parts of the screen without moving your hand).Face ID:I was skeptical to say the least, but Face ID works (almost) perfect. It does however learn from its missteps and if it fails to identify you, it will add that data to its cache. I personally scanned my face normally the first time and on the second scan did it at roughly a 45 degree angle so I could lean over my phone to view notifications. As I've adjusted to Face ID, it has gotten faster and faster at scanning my face and it's not something you need to wait on to open your phone. By the time you swipe up on your phone, it's unlocked and ready to go (I seriously forget I have a password). I also really enjoy the ability to utilize Face ID for my password for other logins and the ability to open up an app directly from the lock screen without having to then enter my fingerprint/passcode.It's important to note here that your privacy is well, yours. No one has access to the data Face ID gather's and it is truly yours. Apple has a good track record on keeping your data private as they are not in the data business (hello Google & Facebook).The price:There seems to be this running idea that a $1,000 phone is a crazy purchase, but I would have to disagree. Why? My logic is as followed: Phone's are one of the most used devices (easily mine) so for starters, I would like a nice one. If I didn't buy the device in full, I would have been paying roughly $2/ a day on a contract with Verizon. The base model is a 64GB iPhone loaded with the best Apple has to offer. A 128GB 6S at launch was $850. Yes, there's a price difference, but my point is that it's not as gigantic as it may seem. I personally would advocate a 64GB version and utilizing cloud storage if you need more space, but do note, this is Apple's flagship and there are cheaper iPhone's out there.What I love:- The screen looks amazing. The colors are vibrant, the blacks are deep with black wallpapers flowing aimlessly into the phone (to the point you cannot see the notch in the screen if the wallpaper is black).- The Notch! Yes, the notch. Some people seem to hate it, I think it's iconic and makes the iPhone X stand alone in oled sphere. It fades into the user experience and I have not had any issues with it.- The screen size. I have always wanted a plus, but I always felt like it was too big for my hands. That I would drop the phone and there it goes. The X remedies this for me and I get to use a larger screen in nearly the same form factor as my 6S. The screen truly looks amazing and if you haven't seen one, check one out at a local store.- I'm not sure how much of this is just because my 6S was a few years old, but the taptic engine in the X is amazing. As in, when the phone vibrates, I can easily identify what it is through the vibration and the vibration itself feels smooth.- Force touch is also fantastic and the haptic feedback on everything from a like on twitter to moving apps around is wonderful. Makes the screen feel more three-dimensional in a way.- The camera takes wonderful pictures. I have taken a few pictures in portrait mode and some pictures genuinely look like they were taken with a DSLR camera.- The speakers are louder than I expected and sound very clear. Great for impromptu music listening.- The phone is a little heavy, but it is definitely comfortable to hold. It feels like a luxury device and has a certain weight to it.What I don't:Honestly, I do not have a genuine complaint at this point. The only complaint that comes to mind revolves around the lack of optimization I have faced in some apps, but that is a developer problem and even then, developers have optimized a majority of their apps and my issues have been few and far between."
"Amazon" "This is WebOS reborn and good riddance Home Button - after using this you won’t ever go back to such a clunky unintuitive way to do things again - WebOS was doing this in 2007 - with the X Apple has caught up at last and in doing so has left every other present (Android and iOS) offering left for dead.(Watch some YouTube videos of iPhone X and WebOS comparisons - remarkably similar - took Apple 10 years to catch up)I won’t much go over how gorgeous the hardware is - that’s evident.- I mean just look at it and handle it.I have the 64 GB silver - which is the most attractive version. The back of it glows - it’s beautiful to behold and wonderful to Handle and use - couple it with the Spigen Clear case - don’t hide the elegance and beauty - and those cases protect well using advanced materials for under £8. (In 5 years I’ve never damaged a phone when using the Spigen Clear).The screen is bigger than that of an iPhone Plus - but the handset is regular iPhone (6,7,8) sized - a tad bigger but hardly noticeable in the hand - and yes, unlike the iPhone Plus you can use this more or less one handed.The build quality is impeccable - it really is a premium device - the touch and feel - materials used - the screen pops at you (the ‘notch’ has the cameras and is a design feature which reminds me of the bite taken out of the Apple - it differentiates your device from a common or garden Android cross breed) and the speakers are evidently louder and fuller with more range of sound and resonance than normal mobile phone speakers - so you can actually listen to music on it.(I wonder how the built in sound DSP DAC compares and fares in tests?)Battery life is the best I’ve seen on a smartphone - a whole day of heavy use and by midnight I still had 40%.Reception and call quality again is as good as you can get.The hardware is gorgeous and coupled with the advanced internals you the have best handset on the market.But gorgeous hardware isn’t what makes a phone great - that’s the OS - and a modern OS should be user friendly, intuitive, beautiful to look at and a joy to use - it should also be fast and stable - so no annoying crashes or screen lock ups - this flies through every test and is a pleasure to use.Firstly Face ID - works more efficiently and more responsive than the finger sensor - works even in the dark and early morning with curtains shut and face screwed up - also effortlessly works with the browser, App Store purchases and other apps - and most apps have been updated to use this plus the gestures and screen of this iPhone X.The OS is a killer - the removal of the home button is a massive plus feature which turns a clunky device into magic - leaving any half baked Android offering eating dust.iOS 11 on the iPhone X is WebOS 2017 - to think that Palm was so far ahead of its time - it built the most elegant and intuitive mobile phone OS back in the noughties - it’s give or take what the experience on the iPhone X is today.The iPhone X is beautiful to use intuitive gesture based card system more of less as was WebOS - switching apps? Swipe across the bottom - closing apps? Gently touch and Swipe a card up - switch apps? Swipe up and select the cards - and it multitasks properly - the camera and YouTube will run in card form (as on the WebOS TouchPad and Pre 3) - using every part of the screen to good effect - swipe from top right - from top or bottom reveals other features - and all fast responsive and with not a single crash or screen lock up in sight.I always hated the home button - coming from WebOS and HP Touchpad the iOS of the day was clunky and unintuitive - I noticed over the years how the iOS versions slowly morphed into what WebOS was - the morphing is complete with the dropping of the Hone Button and an adoption of an elegant intuitive card gesture based system which is a pleasure to use - the iPhone X is the best handset in the market and with the new iOS version it’s clearly the most beautiful intuitive elegant and user friendly - most stable and effortless OS on the market.A winner - thank you Apple and thank you Palm WebOS."
"Amazon" "Just got my iPhone X yesterday as an upgrade to a still fully functional iPhone 6+. Is it a good phone? Certainly. Definitely in the top 5 out there. The point is, if you are like me, your phone is a utilitarian device. As such the iPhone X is really not a very impressive upgrade from the iPhone 6+. Is the screen better? Yes but so what? The 6+ screen was fine and the differences, as a practical matter, are not important. It is faster but the 6+ was more than fast enough. Better cameras. Sure. But who cares? The 6+ cameras were good enough. Aesthetics are better but, again, not earth shattering and not worth a premium upgrade. The UI changes are a PIA. Sure, you can learn them but I can’t say they are better - just different. Why fix something that was not broken. Battery life is not substantially different. All in all, was it worth the upgrade? Not really. This is not saying the iPhone X is not a good phone. It is but it as a practical matter, the functionality of the improvement is marginal at best. I think Apple has run out of ideas or this product category is now so mature that there is little useful innovation left to squeeze out. What would be impressive and ground breaking? Radically improved radio performance or battery life. That would make for a marked improvement in utility."
"Amazon" "This is a great phone with an amazing camera.  The facial recognition really blew me away.  And the case is thin enough that it can charge on a charging mat (not provided) if that's your fancy.  Plenty of memory and I just inserted a SIM card from my \"pay as you go\" provider and now I enjoy all the features and benefits without the expensive cell phone contracts that others use.  I will advise you that this phone sells for approximately $1,150 in retail stores everywhere, so don't be taken in by sellers asking $1,300 or more.If you intend use this for a non-contract provider, you may have to enter the APN information from your provider in order for the phone to have full functionality (such as sending photos with text messages).  Also, not all pay as you go providers guarantee the phone will work with their service, so be sure to find out before you make the phone purchase."
"Amazon" "iPhone X came brand new and sealed. Immediately opened and turned the iPhone on. After taking sim card out of my current iphone and placing it into the X, it worked perfectly! I was a little nervous given about spending as much as I did from a seller I hadn't heard of, but it was the best thing I ever did!"
"Amazon" "I think people need to comprehend if they are reviewing the price OR THE PEFORMANCE OF THE PHONE.  You can’t give a crappy review because you don’t like the price.As for me I’m pretty much bleh towards the phone.  Have had it almost a week and I guess it was worth 1000.  If it disappeared tomorrow and I had to go back to my 6s plus, don’t think I would bat an eye.  But I cannot say that it is full of bugs and issues.  Does take some getting used to on no home button but have not had any problems with mine.  Would also suggest the lifeproof next case.  Otterbox was junk in terms of how the side buttons would respond.  Lifeproof slam doesn’t cover the charging port and really doesn’t have much water repelleing properties (yes I know the X aready has water resistant properties).  Life proof next covers all ports and really works greatwith the side buttons.  Plus clear back shows the exterior of the phone nicely."

"Amazon" "It is the best iphone I've ever had, I've had Iphone 5, 5s, 6, 6S Plus, 7 PlusThis is by far the better, right size, nice presentation, fast, good new features.New gestures to activate but not problema at all, I learnt them very fast"
"Amazon" "iPhone X review: This is me telling what it has been like with the iPhone X the past six days of me using the device.Feel of device: Great feel to the device , the glass back makes the device less slippery but also trades off for more fingerprints. The glass back makes it heavier then the iPhone 7 but I like that because it’s feels more premium to the hand.Battery: The battery has but ok for the phone size , in a heavy user can I can get 10 hours out of the device with 5 sot. So I would it’s good battery life but it could be better if apple give us a bigger battery. Light user will get through a full day with no problem.Screen : What can I say this screen is the best one to touch an iPhone yet! I lover the way everything just pops at you with this display . It’s on par with the Note 8 screen if not better from my personal believe. This screen is longer then the one on the 7 plus but it is not as wide as that screen and I like that but many people do not! It feels better in my hand with the more narrow screen.Speakers: They are very loud compared to my iPhone 7 Plus big upgrade. I keep them around 70% volume. It’s very clear and crisp ! They ear speaker at the top is about loud as the bottom fire speaker now  ! That’s no exaggeration  neither.No Touch ID: I forget about it completely but I did see myself reaching for it the first two days of use.Face ID: I’m loving it so far! It was a learning curve though you can’t put it to close or to far away from your face. I found the elbow length away from your face is the perfect position. It does work in complete darkness I tested this while and a closet a night time lol.Cameras: if you had the iPhone 7 like me the iPhone X cameras are a slight improvement with quality, The stabilization is what has improved greatly ! Everybody that has shakey hands recording I’m glad to say the iPhone X is your cure. Portrait mode is great when it works ! You have to have perfectly lighting and also have to be close to the phone for it to work I hate that . When you do it get to work the results are amazing to say the least.The notch: Your eyes will naturally start to ignore it if it’s not even there.Overall experience: I’m liking this device and enjoying everything about , the multitasking is better now because you can just switch through apps from a left swipe from bottom of screen, One thing that is keeping me from recommending this phone is the price tag. No phone should cost $1,000 and I urge anyone only to buy this phone if you can get it at a discount and if you can get it at a bargain I would tell everybody to try the iPhone X out for a go!!"
"Amazon" "The phone arrived in perfect condition. Well packaged and satisfying to unbox. Brand new and sealed!"
"Amazon" "It’s slower to start up and the facial recognition only works part of the time.  No home button just means form over function.  The iOS is buggy and hangs up when you switch between apps."
"Amazon" "Someone with five helpful reviews stated  that the iPhone for sale here is fake using the evidence that the iPhone on the back say iPhone X, this is completely untrue if you go to the Apple site and look at the back of the phone it just says iPhone."
"Amazon" "Apple iPhone X, GSM Unlocked 5.8\", 64 GB - Space GraySold by: Aimsky, LLCI love this phone! this is my first apple product (android fanboy my entire life google products only)."
"Amazon" "Unlocked, sealed and fast shipping. Just what I had paid for. Thanks!"
"Amazon" "Awesome phone!Just ship things on time next time."
"Amazon" "As expected. The product was brand new as if I bought from apple, included everything that is said to be included. No need to worry, it is not fake. It’s unlocked, but the original phone. The phone itself is a huge upgrade from the iPhone 5s. The camera is better than most new phone cameras (4K), Face ID works great for me, the all glass design is fragile, but a good case can protect it from a fall. Overall I think it is worth the price mainly because it has the best iPhone camera, the Animoji’s are worth it, and because it’s unique people immediately will know it’s an iPhone X just from looking at  the back of it. I’m happy with my purchase, I’m loving it and this phone will sure last me awhile."

"Amazon" "Nice phone and it’s real, now I just write this review with this phone!🤙"
"Amazon" "The phone was quick to overheat during i cloud backups, most buggy iphone i ever had, screen dimensions and format are terrible, worse than any previous phones, curved edges and notch at top gove you less surface than th8 plus and in some cases maybe even thr 8, app developers yet to optimize apps, wasted space at bottom of phone and top as apps and even imessages dont use it."
"Amazon" "Product came is the package as desscribed within two days.  I have no issues phone works great I am enjoying it.  coming off of a Samsung 8+ And a gear S2.  Took a couple of days to get used to the gestures again (webos).  Overall a good product.  And five stars to the seller"

"Amazon" "Perfect phone and perfect transaction - A+++ vendor. Thank you"
"Amazon" "Shipping arrive one time phone was brand new in a seal box"
"Amazon" "I upgraded from the iPhone 6+ to the X at full price through AT&T. It took nearly 6 weeks to receive. It is significantly small than the iPhone 6 plus by size. The actual screen dimensions is about the same. Yes, the color is somewhat brighter but the clarity and brightness is not (even with adjustments). Simple to set up and outside of no home button (swipe up), it is essentially the same layout. I would agree with other reviewers, it is no faster than the older model. The camera does produce a nicer photo but is this device worth $1300 for a better camera? I do not think so. You could purchase an even nicer camera for less. Facial recognition is fair to good but far from perfect. I ended up switching to digital security since I use the phone for work. I need as close to absolute security as possible. Speaker sound is better in volume and clarity. As you go from screen to screen (different applications), you can literally feel the phone shake like one use to feel hard drives activate in older laptops. I do not know what is up with this since in all my previous iPhones I never felt any mechanical movement from the phone itself. Everything works appropriately but this brief vibration is more annoying to me than the absence of the home button and being able to turn the phone off my pressing one button instead of two. Bad workmanship to engineering. Bottom line: if you do not absolutely have to upgrade your phone or you are not receiving the phone free (AT&T is giving a free iPhone 8 with an added line), then I would wait for the next generation. A larger phone is anticipated with the \"X\" features but I must admit I find the \"X\" is under-featured when it comes to being a pivotal new generation of iPhones. The iPhone X is anything but pivotal, ground breaking (outside of dropping it, it will indeed break) or full of new useful features you do not already have on your current iPhone. Even if I had to upgrade I would go with the iPhone 8 plus over the \"X\" since you keep the home button and larger size is nice for jacket pocket and those with bigger hands. To say I am disappointed in the iPhone X is an understatement. I have monitors which are more impressive than this phone's screen and cost a third of this phone. In my world, I have already abandoned the Apple laptops and iMacs for my workplace and home for similar unimpressive advancements in technology. I am now going to do the same with my phones as well. Will try Samsung and other models for the future. Apple is loosing their magic touch since the loss of Steve Jobs. Some individuals do indeed make a company great. I have little doubt Jobs would have been very unhappy with this iPhone and would never have released it but made the company wait 6-12 months to have something truly better than the status quo. Otherwise it is my conviction this model was put out to make money and all of us fools who fell for this are now truly paying the price. This is a turning point for me with Apple. I am done with their products. I am done with iTunes (music). \"Alexa, never order any more Apple products for me! And please play current hits and call my office.\""
"Amazon" "Great phone. I love it. I need iphone for my business so im buying for show off. Works great and thats what i need. Thank u"
"Amazon" "Thankx"
"Amazon" "Best iPhone ever"
"Amazon" "Unlike the iPhone 8 Plus, here the camera module has sharp edges and is positioned vertically.When the device is on the table, on the back, it actually always lies on the camera module and if you press the housing, it starts walking on a flat surface. The dimensions of the device are such that it is wide and quite noticeably cuts into the hand. The back panel is made of tempered glass, as well as the front panel covering the screen with oleophobic coating, but the marks from the hands are clearly visible. The glass panel behind is needed for wireless charging. On the left side there is a lever, which includes a noiseless mode, below - two volume keys. On the right side, the on / off button (in fact, it's now unlocking and calling Siri), just below - the tray for the nanoSIM card. At the bottom of the right is the speaker, the second speaker is on the front panel above the screen. They work in pairs, and the volume of the sound is different, for this parameter iPhone X can give odds to many flagships, and I like it in this aspect. The microphone is on the bottom end, and also at the camera block behind. At the top end, the microphone was not placed. The noise reduction system works medium, in noisy conditions your interlocutor hears strange sounds. Places for the percentage of battery power on the display just do not.In iPhone X, the battery charge is very quickly consumed during voice calls, which is not typical for such devices.Unlike a fingerprint, you can register only one person. No way to share the phone with biometrics, only a password that can be passed on to someone.In practice, face recognition is quickly adjusted.When driving the iPhone X, the phone holder will have to be strongly shifted to the left to the handlebar, and also tilt it towards the face, otherwise no recognition occurs.I really like how the device records video (especially 4K at a rate of 60 frames per second), but this video can only be viewed on the device itself, since a new compression format is used, when transmitting all video is converted. In the maximum resolution mode, the sound is written to one microphone.In iPhone X changed the interface and it will take a little time to get used to the lack of the \"Home\" key."
"Amazon" "It’s a great phone"
"Amazon" "LOVE IT"
"Amazon" "Hey there I am a YouTubed and I am wanting to do a video over the new iPhone X I would like a free sample please thank you!!"
"Amazon" "Seems like a great product and I would really enjoy a free sample of this product to test and promote this product"
"Amazon" "This is the worst iPhone I’ve had the miss fortune of having. It malfunctions all the time and doesn’t work all the time when you press simple radio buttons for the flash light, very frustrating. Pictures are good, but so are the 7."
"Amazon" "i would love to review your product!!"
"Amazon" "I've had an iPhone for many years & was very excited to hear about this one. I love how there's no home button, which I thought would annoy me. Unfortunately, its not at all stable. My first iPhone X completely died from 40% battery charge. I left it plugged in for the whole day to a working charger & it still wouldn't turn on. I went to an Apple Store, and they replaced it. The second iPhone X worked very well until tonight. Now, it will not open any links in Safari. Both iPhones have refused to unlock with a passcode...sometimes crashing as many as 6 times in a row before unlocking. Its kind of ridiculous how Apple could put out an iPhone like this, when its pretty obviously still a test model.I've been an Apple user my whole life, and this is the first time I've been so disappointed by one of their products."
"Amazon" "Too buggy. I liked my iPhone 8 better. The top part of the screen seems like such a waste. It looks cool, but still. I was hoping to have a solid contender to the Pixel 2 XL that Google sent me to beta test, but it didn't seem to match up. The display itself on the iPhone X is beautiful. The colors are a bit better than the Pixel 2 XL's, but not enough to look past the other shortcomings. The camera on the iPhone X is really cool, but for the type of photos I like to take, the Pixel 2 XL's camera wins.If I still had my iPhone 8, I would definitely prefer it over the iPhone X.I think Apple went a little too high on the cost at first and didn't properly delegate their time on the other aspects of the device that were also important.I know Apple will quickly fix the bugs and weird quirks the iPhone X has now, but it would've been nice to feel like the money was well spent when I received it.I'll update my review in a month."

"Amazon" "Not a good iphone"
"Amazon" "There’s no reason to hate on a newly released phone that is the same price as buying it directly from Apple. I think these phones are awesome. Of course, I don’t have the money or an issue with my current phone, so I can’t buy it now, but rest assured I would."
"Amazon" "IPHONE X is our future."

"Amazon" "Why my iphone has a tmobile chip  Inside??? I dont understand because is new that wouldnt happend !!!!"
"Amazon" "No headphone jack"
"Amazon" "Awesome paperweight!! Best paperweight on amazon. My favorite part of this phone is the included 6 month self destruct feature. You know, when the battery turns into a 1hr battery and won't hold a charge. It's fun because everyone else that had an apple does a social huddle around a wall outlet, enabling you to meet other window licking doofuses that bought phones with antiquated technology.Do yourself a favor, and buy a jitterbug. If you're ready to be a human, buy an Android. If you want to continue panic charging and eating lead paint...stick with apple."
"Amazon" "1500 is not a price anyone should ever be willing to pay for a phone. It better drive my car and help me fight crime! Otherwise it'll be a crime to pay for it."

"Amazon" "This phone is all about that display, and I couldn’t stop looking at it. It’s really amazing. It’s bright, it’s vivid, and it’s enormous.The iPhone X is the future, and I can’t wait to learn more about the capabilities and various gestures possible.My sons already love it so much that I have to get 2 more for them tomorrow. Maybe even today. LolThat’s how excellent and superb the X is."
"Amazon" "nice and awesome product. I fall in love with it."
"Amazon" "Everything is great"
"Amazon" "No bad"
"Amazon" "I received my X on launch day and I absolutely love this phone. If you would like a list of just my thoughts on the phone, scroll down pass the introduction.The transition:NO home button! The staple of the iPhone is gone; well, moved to a little notch at the top. I was expecting this transition to  a home-button-less iPhone to be difficult, but all of the gestures feel so natural. I find myself annoyed trying to utilized an older iPhone as the interface now feels clunky. Switching through apps, opening the phone, accessing everything, it's all so easy. Now, this isn't to say there isn't a transition and while everything feels natural, there is a period of time where you have to get used to the new interface and some aspects that initially seemed difficult become second nature. For example, reachability was a favorite feature of mine and while it was initially hard to activate, I have now learned how to activate it without an issue (reachability brings the iPhone screen down halfway to reach top parts of the screen without moving your hand).Face ID:I was skeptical to say the least, but Face ID works (almost) perfect. It does however learn from its missteps and if it fails to identify you, it will add that data to its cache. I personally scanned my face normally the first time and on the second scan did it at roughly a 45 degree angle so I could lean over my phone to view notifications. As I've adjusted to Face ID, it has gotten faster and faster at scanning my face and it's not something you need to wait on to open your phone. By the time you swipe up on your phone, it's unlocked and ready to go (I seriously forget I have a password). I also really enjoy the ability to utilize Face ID for my password for other logins and the ability to open up an app directly from the lock screen without having to then enter my fingerprint/passcode.It's important to note here that your privacy is well, yours. No one has access to the data Face ID gather's and it is truly yours. Apple has a good track record on keeping your data private as they are not in the data business (hello Google & Facebook).The price:There seems to be this running idea that a $1,000 phone is a crazy purchase, but I would have to disagree. Why? My logic is as followed: Phone's are one of the most used devices (easily mine) so for starters, I would like a nice one. If I didn't buy the device in full, I would have been paying roughly $2/ a day on a contract with Verizon. The base model is a 64GB iPhone loaded with the best Apple has to offer. A 128GB 6S at launch was $850. Yes, there's a price difference, but my point is that it's not as gigantic as it may seem. I personally would advocate a 64GB version and utilizing cloud storage if you need more space, but do note, this is Apple's flagship and there are cheaper iPhone's out there.What I love:- The screen looks amazing. The colors are vibrant, the blacks are deep with black wallpapers flowing aimlessly into the phone (to the point you cannot see the notch in the screen if the wallpaper is black).- The Notch! Yes, the notch. Some people seem to hate it, I think it's iconic and makes the iPhone X stand alone in oled sphere. It fades into the user experience and I have not had any issues with it.- The screen size. I have always wanted a plus, but I always felt like it was too big for my hands. That I would drop the phone and there it goes. The X remedies this for me and I get to use a larger screen in nearly the same form factor as my 6S. The screen truly looks amazing and if you haven't seen one, check one out at a local store.- I'm not sure how much of this is just because my 6S was a few years old, but the taptic engine in the X is amazing. As in, when the phone vibrates, I can easily identify what it is through the vibration and the vibration itself feels smooth.- Force touch is also fantastic and the haptic feedback on everything from a like on twitter to moving apps around is wonderful. Makes the screen feel more three-dimensional in a way.- The camera takes wonderful pictures. I have taken a few pictures in portrait mode and some pictures genuinely look like they were taken with a DSLR camera.- The speakers are louder than I expected and sound very clear. Great for impromptu music listening.- The phone is a little heavy, but it is definitely comfortable to hold. It feels like a luxury device and has a certain weight to it.What I don't:Honestly, I do not have a genuine complaint at this point. The only complaint that comes to mind revolves around the lack of optimization I have faced in some apps, but that is a developer problem and even then, developers have optimized a majority of their apps and my issues have been few and far between."
"Amazon" "Everyone reading this is probably familiar with the Apple phone line up so I am going to focus on the differences between the iPhone X and iPhone 7 plus specifically.First off, the set-up process has been significantly streamlined. When setting up your new iPhone X setup will ask you if your old iPhone is nearby, select yes, and you can wireless transfer all your apps, settings, backgrounds, passwords, etc. to your new phone in a few clicks. I really appreciated this streamlined process and it was incredibly quick and easy to transfer all my settings to my new iPhone X.The other main features that have been upgraded are as follows:New screen (5.8” OLED is the most vibrant and clear screen ever produced by Apple)- Apple has removed the touch ID sensor and bezel around the old iPhone screen which means the iPhone X has a noticeably smaller footprint while maintaining a larger screen size than the iPhone 7/8 Plus. (See comparison images attached of the iPhone X versus iPhone 7 Plus).- OLED Screen offers deeper blacks and brighter whites resulting in greater color reproduction.- Similar to the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus the iPhone X uses true tone technology to mimic the lighting conditions around it and adjust the white balance accordingly.- The notch cut out of the top of the screen is where Apple has included the face recognition sensors, front camera, and a host of other sensors. I thought this would be annoying but Apple has cleverly used the screen real estate on both sides to include the time, date, battery indicators, etc.Farewell Touch-ID, Hello Face-ID- Face-ID is Apples new facial recognition technology which has replaced the finger printer reader and home button in order to free up additional screen real-estate. This is new and only available on the iPhone X.- Apples facial recognition is light years ahead of Samsung or any other carrier. I have tested this flawlessly with glasses, a hat, and even in the dark. It is as simple as looking at your phone and swiping up from the bottom.- I was worried this feature would be inconsistent or frustrating but it has worked really well. The only time it is a bit more inconvenient is if the phone is sitting on your desk or a flat surface you kind of have to lean over a bit or angle the phone towards you to unlock it.- This super powerful new camera also enables the animoji features which maps your facial expressions to create a talking emoji. This is a fun feature but more a novelty than anything.- This same true-depth camera makes the iPhone X the ultimate phone for taking selfies. The new portrait mode allows the user blur the background, or even cut yourself out entirely and place yourself on a black background.Additional noteworthy features and changes:- The rear camera boasts a dual 12MP sensor array with improved aperture and wide angle lens with image stabilization. The increased aperture from 2.8 to 2.4 allows for better images in low light conditions.- Video capabilities have also approved as well to include 60p 4k video recording delivering clear, fluid images.- Increased audio quality and volume- Increased RAM size to 3GB and new Bionic Chip makes the iPhone X one of the most powerful smartphones are the market.- Updated design features glass back and sides which make the phone beautiful looking. A very welcome change in the normal design.- Battery life: The iPhone X boasts the largest battery in Apple history with a 2716 mAh battery which is a bit larger than the new iPhone 8 Plus. A full charge from 0-100% takes about 2 hours and 10 minutes in my testing.- In addition, wireless charging has finally been added to the new iPhone X, and 8 series phones. I have not tested this out but am excited to give it a try (Wireless charging pad is not included with the phone).Bottom line, the iPhone X is another smash hit from Apple. Every feature people were concerned about turned out to work flawlessly as usual. I have only had the iPhone for about 24 hours so it is early to leave a long-term focused review but so far the new iPhone X has lived up to the hype. The iPhone X may not revolutionize the smart phone industry but it is a welcome upgrade to the iPhone which designs were getting a bit dated. I am excited about Apples new strategy to release a flagship model and allow the new features to trickle down to next generation’s phones.If you have the money to spare you won’t likely be disappointed. My only complaint is the phone only comes in 64GB or 256GB basically forcing users to pay an extra $150 to get decent storage. Further, the beautiful glass back on the screen feels fantastic and has a great weight to it. However, a replacement screen will cost you $275+ and the back glass replacement is rumored to cost around $400. Essentially a single drop could result in a $700 repair bill. Unfortunately this means most phones will be shielded in a case and will not be enjoyed."
"Amazon" "Full disclosure, I bought my iPhone X yesterday at ATT.  It is not the unlocked one, but as someone who was hesitant to make the switch, I wanted to write a review.  I never get the latest and greatest technology.  I always waited and go the \"s\" version of the new iPhone.  But the pull of longer battery life and a larger screen in a normal size phone overcame my concern of price, a few negative reviews, and to be honest, the stigma of having the most expensive iPhone ever.  I am so glad I did.  This phone is amazing.Highlights:  Great battery life.  On my old iPhone, a 6s, I could get about 4 hours of moderate use before I had to charge, maybe 2 hours of heavy use.  I went all day with moderate to heavy use and used less than 50% of my battery.  The screen is as beautiful as all the people say.  I have found many of my apps have already been updated to take advantage of the screen.  The new gestures are very intuitive and in less than 12 hours I was completely used to them.  Facial recognition is fast and I haven't had a single issue.  I am terrible at taking pictures and this phone makes me look like I know what I am doing.  Though there are a lot of setting options, they are really easy to navigate through.  They say this is the bestsmartphone ever, and I have to agree.Negatives:  Because this is so expensive, you might be a little overprotective.  And you should be.  But on my wireless plan, it only increased my payment about $8 month.  I don't find that to really be a negative.  I haven't found anything I don't like about this phone yet.This is a truly awesome phone."
"Amazon" "Have had phone 10 days and OLED screen is experiencing green line on edge of screen. CNET and Apple’s own user community forum are indicating this is hardware manufacturing defect. Screen has green hue overall, so I now have to schedule appointment at Apple Genius to return for replacement."
"Amazon" "Love love!! Getting another one for my mom as her Christmas present!!"
"Amazon" "Not a fan of the fragile glass back which costs 550 dollars and a complete disassembly/chassis replacement to fix. That is a massive design failure by making something that should be user replaceable such as the iPhone 4s back. Now I’m left with a shattered phone which can’t be fixed. It’s a good thing I have a phone case to stop me from cutting my hands, otherwise it would be a safety hazard. FYI, this happened with my case on. If you choose to have Apple fix this issue they will be replacing the entire phone which is environmentally irresponsible and greedy by pocketing 160 of that 550 you paid.Besides that this is a solid phone comparatively, I do like the stainless steel frame over their aluminum from the past but wish that I could omit wireless charging and have the stainless steel material throughout."
"Amazon" "I have had the x for sometime now.  I can say that of all the iphones, the x is my biggest disappointment. I do not always get text messages, my reminders may or may not notify me, I can no longer send a text with the special effects, etc.  This morning my alarm sounded for maybe two seconds and then just shut off.  I have been told to bring it back due to it being a hardware issue.  Now, I get that these things may happen on occasion but the fact that close to 50% of people that I know that did splurge for the x are having issues.  Some, including my husband, are opting not to make a swap because they don't really care about the special effects???  It's more than that.  I feel this product was prematurely released and I not happy.  The not having a home button is an adjustment, can't say I'm a fan.  The face recognition is awful.  I feel that it is a HUGE safety concern.  If someone grabs your phone, be it your child in school and whether it be horsing around or not, they grab the phone and unlock it with your face and run off.  A young mom, walking with a stroller and small toddler in tow, gets mugged, a shopper distracted on their phone and a thug steels it.  These are all legit concerns.  Yes, you can opt to not use it, which my family has done.  I am truly disappointed.  I called Apple customer care and was told that they have received many calls like mine.  The x by far being the most complaints with hardware issues.  Save your money and get the 8 or maybe try another brand but do not waste your money on the x."
"Amazon" "My brothers and I began buying and upgraded to the latest iPhone since the very first version and the iPhone X is one the the biggest changes that I can remember. Much like going from the iPhone 3GS to the 4 was or the iPhone 5 to the 6.The X model looses the Home Button and doesn’t have a the headphone jack like the 7’s. No big deal on the headphone jack. Sometimes I do prefer plugging a set in and not having to worry about Bluetooth.The lack of a Home button does take some time getting use too. It is really different with the swipe gestures but after a day or so you get use to it. Basically learning a new way to switch and X out of apps. I like it now after using it.The phone is fast, feels crisper than the 7. Safari is snappier and pretty much all the apps are.The phones size is somewhat like the 7, feels thinner but is a tad larger.If you can afford it, you will be happy. I played with the iPhone 8 and it feels quicker too.The Face ID works really well. Being brothers that look a lot alike we try to trick it but it doesn’t work. This is the first of what will be new technologies for Apple like the Face ID, this was probably rushed and the next version will be more secure and work better. But it seems to work fine right now and does take the place of the finger ID pretty well.Camera takes awesome pictures.The 256g model can hold a lot of data which is nice and since your spending a grand you might as well spend the extra money and get the extra memoryPleased so far and looks like a solid reliable phone. In all fairness though, I could get by just fine with the iPhone 7 that I have been using. The main thing I like is the larger screen which is gorgeous and the faster processor. I love the phone but honestly I could have waited a year for the next model. If you can afford it now you’ll enjoy it. The size is perfect for me and the screen is awesome.Get a good case to protect it with which also hide the gorgeous design. I never really saw the iPhone 7 in black that I had because I always had it in a heavy duty case to protect it. It’s a shame to hide such great looking devices but you kinda have to so they don’t get dinged up."
"Amazon" "DO NOT BUY IT!  There is manufacture defect & the seller advise you to deal with the Apple.  Apple released SIM FREE so no reason to buy this at all."
"Amazon" "Beautiful piece of electronics.  Now if I can just learn to use it. A lot of good features that I want to use."
"Amazon" "The size is good for reading e-books and for playing Bridge Baron. Slice of Life Stories"
"Amazon" "Everything ok"
"Amazon" "Came on time and it was perfect  ( box , cellphone) everything was perfect ."
"Amazon" "My iPhone X expierence so far. Preordered on Oct. 27th and managed to get a Gray/Black 256GB Iphone X. Finally arrives on the 6th and I don’t get a chance to open it up and attempt to hook up my new phone until the 11th. So here I go beaming with excitement to check out my new device that just cost me the equivalent of a house payment. Open it up and everything looks good at first and then I use my iPhone 6S light to look at the screen for any dust as I’ve already gotten a screen protector in hand to put on my new device before I even get started. Then I see it. A very very small scratch or crack under the screen coming from the notch area at the top of the phone coming down maybe 1/2 a cm long. So I schedule an appointment to talk to an Apple rep. for 8:45am and he finally calls me at 8:48am. I explain to him what I observed on my phone and he doesn’t seem to thrilled to help me out today. Maybe because it’s a Saturday and he’s at work. During our conversation he makes a statement that I didn’t really care for. Such as... Maybe the delivery man dropped your package and maybe that’s what happened. Obviously this is a manufacturing defect since it’s under the screen. So I get two options. Option A) Send my phone in to be repaired and who knows how long that will take and why would I want a brand new item I just paid a lot of money for to be repaired due to a defect. Option B) Go to the Apple Store and have them look at it and I can try and request a new phone. Oh and the next available time I can get an appointment is 4 days away and I’ll have to take off work early to resolve an Apple manufacturing defect. So I guess we will see how my Apple Store experience goes. I’ve had an Apple phone going back to the 3GS days and I’ve dealt with Apple Customer Service in the past with no issues but so far I’d have to say I’m extremely disappointed in the quality control of the IPhone X and the customer service expierence with Apple. Hopefully all is redeemed on the 14th. To be continued..."
"Amazon" "Upgraded from an iPhone 8 Plus. Must say it took some time getting used to the X but I love it. FaceID has worked well over 80 % of the time for me. The OLED screen is beautiful. The notch is not noticeable after you get used to it and distinguishes the iPhone."
"Amazon" "the best phone"
"Amazon" "Great!!!!"
"Amazon" "I want it for freee"
"Amazon" "Best iPhone ever. Thumbs up for the store I bought it from."
"Amazon" "IPhone X love it"
"Amazon" "just bought an iPhone X for my son in college to replace his iPhone 7+. He called us tonight but the speakerphone quality was horrible. He could hear us fine but it sounded like he was underwater (it was too difficult to understand him so we hung up early). I am quite sure it was not a signal issue as we speak with him every Sunday from his apartment with good signal (AT&T). My advice is to take your time ordering in case it is a hardware defect that cannot be solved by a software update. Hopefully it is the latter given what I paid for it."
"Amazon" "Compared to my iphone 6s oled screen sucks...Terrible angle view... you can see 50 shades of each colour depends the angle...white turns to blue or red or green...Its heavy and you can feel itMaybe thats the reasson that the x is the moat fragile iphone everNot happy at all"
"Amazon" "I cant wait to be apart of history by owning this GREAT phone!"
"Amazon" "One of the best photo"
"Amazon" "Everything was fine!"
"Amazon" "It came perfectly not a scratch the display was amazing"
"Amazon" "cool iPhone"
"Amazon" "Apple Is My Favorite Electronic Provider"
"Amazon" "Great phone so far"
"Amazon" "This thing stinks"
"Amazon" "horrible, I sent mine back days after I received mine, ok 1st of all, who would purchase a phone for $1000+ you have to be dumb to buy one, I'm either hoping the 8 is better or I'm getting Samsung which was my 1st thought but then thought about Apple, obviously Apple didn't work out"
"Amazon" "I will keep this short. Great product, bought unlocked/simless (make certain to put in Verizon SIM for first time to ensure it is unlocked).Screen is great, camera is great, gestures are good and you get used to them. I like FACEID much more than I thought I would- it works!Highly recommend this phone to anyone who wants a smaller version of the 8+ but with a larger screen than the 8....and with a new screen and design!"
"Amazon" "Nice phone, takes great photos, good battery life my only complaint is that no fast charging out the box, Apple charges over premium for this phone and can’t even include accessories needed for full potential, you still need to spend over $50 to get fast charging working unacceptable at this price point.::: takes over 3 hours to charge from 0-100 with Charger included."
"Amazon" "Excellent product and customer service"
"Amazon" "👍"
"Amazon" "I purchased an iPhone 8 64 GB from Ting after using an iPhone 5C for two years. I’m finding it super-fast and enjoyable to use. The screen is bright when it needs to be and dims well in the dark. It’s beautifully manufactured and Has a great camera that’s enhanced by really solid image processing built into iOS. Without doubt, the phone more expensive than it reasonably should be, but keep in mind that when you buy a high-end phone like this, you’re paying for more than the phone itself. You’re paying your part of the cost of running a global enterprise that vets the software available in the App Store for safety, provides a global secure text and voice messaging infrastructure, and invests constantly in developing the phone you’ll buy two to four years from today. Android phones are an awesome alternative, especially the mid-level phones that provide incredible hardware and software flexibility, often for as little as $250. But they’re not as joyful to use or as tightly tied to the Apple ecosystem. It’s a tough choice to make, but the good news is, it’s hard to go wrong. As someone who uses my phone all day long for a hundred different things, buying this phone was an easy call. If you just want a great smartphone and don’t care about the whole Apple universe much, then maybe look elsewhere."
"Amazon" "Amazing phone but the seller charges $30 more than the Apple store just go there to get it plus the warranty is better and you can always add Apple care if you choose!make sure to follow if you find reviews like this helpful!"
"Amazon" "I traded up from a 6s ,and I wished I hadn't.It's constantly freezing.I switch to numerals or caps, and I tap and tap ,nothing happens.Not everytime ,but enough to annoy me.There are a lot of minor inconveniences to numerous to mention.I'm on Sprint ."
"Amazon" "Not very different from iphone 7, but an iphone is an iphone what can I say? It'd be better if it comes with airpods, I do need wireless earphone after earphone jack is removed. But anyways I'm happy with my Leophile wireless earphones, besides it is a lot cheaper"
"Amazon" "Truly a beautiful phone. Much better than expected. Extremely happy with this purchase."
"Amazon" "The IPhone is fully unlocked"
"Amazon" "Great!"
"Amazon" "the phone was not working and it was not unlocking."
"Amazon" "Missing item"
"Amazon" "EXCELENT"
"Amazon" "I will be sincere. Since there are many Android fans here and nobody removes their worthless reviews, i'm commenting just like them.Iphones are reliable and have a nice camera. PERIOD."
"Amazon" "I like your iPhone, I'm wanting to know if I'm willing to test this product out though? Since it's has a low price and many reviews I would like to be one myself and tell you how your products are."
"Amazon" "Arrived on time and as expected"
"Amazon" "After a month of use, it bricked itself overnight. Wouldn't take a charge, wouldn't respond to any input, wouldn't respond to the side button or the hard reset combo. As if that wasn't bad enough, I tried to make an appointment at the local Apple store to get it looked at, they had a TEN DAY wait.Lesson learned: Don't buy an Apple phone if you want any level of support from the manufacturer."
"Amazon" "Good"
"Amazon" "It looked so buetiful"
"Amazon" "works really good and supper portable."
"Amazon" "The problem is no head phone jack.. My wife can't play her music with the AUX connection anymore in one of our cars because the package only included 1 headphone jack converter. Its a drag"
"Amazon" "I upgraded from IPhone 7 for the extra memory and thus far I am really enjoying it.  it looks beautiful but aside from looks the performance has been great and I am very happy with the new IPhone.  The screen is wonderful, so clear and easy to read, everything runs so fast and overall it was totally worth the upgrade from IPhone 7."
"Amazon" "Android fan boys are not to be believed..  they’re just not used to a phone that just works.."
"Amazon" "It is what I expected"
"Amazon" "I was within Apple for years. Used iPhone 3G up to iPhone 7 256GB then lately iPhone 8 and totally found my self in the wrong direction. Extreme heat with bad battery life and horrible backup experience with iTunes and iCloud. I finally quit to Android and found my way in performance, quality and smooth backup operation."
"Amazon" "Compared to my Google pixel 2, the iPhone 8 is garage.-Pixel's AMOLED screen is far more vibrant and produces significantly more colors the the dates iphone's LCD screen.-Google Assistant is far more accurate, faster, and more helpful than Siri.-camera on the Pixel decimates the iphone's camera in low light and day light shots.  Video recording is extremely stabilized and sharp.  Not only is the Pixel camera ranked #1 camera on any phone camera, it is even better on Android 8.1 developer's preview, further widening the gap as the best camera phone.-Android Oreo 8.0 is far more stable and mature over Apple's latest update which looks dated and stale.Overall, I sold my iPhone 8 and kept the pixel 2.  iPhone continues to be 2-3 years behind Android in both hardware and software."
"Amazon" "Apple the brand name itself reassures u that the product will be worthy of every penny u spend... I am not an applE user yet I have seen alot of my frnds who use apple ... 4 , 5 ,6 ,7 ,8... All of then are proud of owning one , not only proud but also happy to be using one. The performance apple pack is every time 5 years ahead of its competitors . I being an Android user , 😅 is without doubt unhappy. I find apple the best over any of its leading competitors . They may boast of more gbs, MPs , but u can just simply say it's not an APPLE. It's always best to have a horse which is healthy than to have many 3 limbed donkeys. Yes u heard it right ... Healthy as a horse that's made for apple. Even a 4s can do better than many of the android phones....😂😂😂........ If u have the bucks go for apple. Nothing else.... Even it's resale value is great that u can upgrade to the newest apple the next yeaR without much trouble if u r a tech savvy...Simply go for it.....Waiting for the day , when I will also buy one.....Ya maybe A 13s ... 😂😂😂😂"
"Amazon" "Really Apple?! I checked it out and played with it. There is nothing at all “different” about this iPhone then an iPhone 4...from what...2009?How is this innovation? I don’t understand it.  I have owned iPhones, windows phones, and android phones over my life. Android and YEAH WINDOWS phones have MADE HUGE improvements...what the F has Apple done? I’m over Apple and they’re over hyped nonsense phones! Google or windows now! The pixel 2 ...Samsung...and Windows lumia 950 or Hp Elite X3...ALL DESTROY this iphone!Apples software is outdated...ugly...boring...and behind the times now! Apple needs a complete makeover...and an actual new “THING”...believe me...”one last thing”...it is NOT!!!"
"Amazon" "Went back to android can't customize anything in this phone just seems like a plain phone a rehash of the same iPhone over and over again boring!!!"
"Amazon" "Nothing special about this phone. I upgraded from a 5s. This phone is a huge disappointment."
"Amazon" "Excellent phone"
"Amazon" "Worst iPhone I’ve ever had.... it is so slippery and poorly designed. It is similar to a bar of soap..."
"Amazon" "It’s literally the same phone as the 7, heck the 7 is probably better. Don’t buy plz."
"Amazon" "THE WORST PHONE EVER MADE AND i AM SURE THE X MODEL IS NO BETTER.THE PHONE DOES NOT HOLD A CHARGE LONG,DROPS CALLS PERIODICALLY.I would say it is the worst of all the iphone models and the model 4 was a better phone than this iphone8,apple is creating junk to pay for the mega corporate spaceship building so it's overpriced phones are short on quality but robs customers of hard earned money. GO BUY SAMSUNG ,SUPERB QUALITY."
"Amazon" "Bad"
"Amazon" "Yayyyy haven't bought it  but whatever looks great 😁😁😁😁"
"Amazon" "bad"
"Amazon" "I'll say that this phone is like flying premium economy. Your seat is a little nicer, and you might get a drink or something. But you're still stuck in an airplane seat for a few hours and you spent quite a bit more money. For some of you, it's money well spent. But many of you won't think so.The hardware is really nice. It feels really good in your hand and it's a great size. The fingerprint sensor and the 3d touch feel very natural and comfortable. It does have a great camera that does low light well. The screen is very good, especially with the true tone feature that adapts to the lighting of your enviornment. However, I don't feel that all of the niceness adds up to the pricetag.There's no expandable storage. It requires a dongle to use headphones/line out. Call quality is only okay. Battery life is comparable to midrange android devices. The A11 processor is overkill and you pay a premium for it.  It comes with some earbuds that can only be used with the iPhone and are of okay quality. You can't charge the phone and use any other accessory without buying more dongles or aftermarket chargers. It comes with a wimpy 1A charger, which would be fine if phones that cost half as much didn't come with 3.2A chargers that can charge a huge battery in 20 minutes.I often subscribe to the idea that \"you get what you pay for\", but in this case, I really don't think you do. I think $700 demands more."
"Amazon" "Great delivery and correct product. On time delivery and as promised and advertised"
"Amazon" "I just want to say that I was not 100% sure about this purchase but now I am more than happy, the phone is original and it was pretty simple to move all the information from my previous iPhone, I love this phone!"
"Amazon" "Great phone. It doesn't come with original box but it's in like new condition. I do feel the difference in speed from the iPhone 7 to the iPhone 8."
"Amazon" "Don’t get me wrong like the iPhone, however i ordered a the grey iPhone and received a white iPhone."
"Amazon" "I expected non Japanese version that means no shutter noise when I take pics. But it was same as iPhone that is sold in Japan..."
"Amazon" "Very good"
"Amazon" "amazing"
"Amazon" "Great phone love it"
"Amazon" "Click on link to get iphone 8 http://amzn.to/2yFPbfd"
"Amazon" "good product"
"Amazon" "Awesome iphone ever and never. True Future smartphone at worth price."
"Amazon" "nice and awesome product. I fall in love with it."
"Amazon" "I get a broken phone"
"Amazon" "I just traded in my iPhone 7 Plus for a new iPhone 8 Plus and I love it. The new glass case is beautiful. I also like the display as it is crisper and the color is perfect on the screen. I purchased a gold phone for my wife and a silver phone for myself.This phone is fast. Don’t believe other comments you might see because I officially rate and run speed tests on my phones.  The gold phone, we purchased, is rated the fastest phone smart phone in the world at this time. It’s Antutu rating is 219575 and the second silver phone is rated at 216318.  This phone just blows away my iPhone 7 Plus with speed and downloading apps and animation quality. My old iPhone 7 Plus was rated at 178438. This speed is due to the new A11 Bionic chip with 64 bit architecture.This phone has the new bluetooth 5 which succeeds bluetooth 4.2. Bluetooth 5 is backward compatible to the previous versions. The new bluetooth has twice the speed of the 4.2 version and about 4 times the range. That is amazing since it uses less power and its message capacity is 255 bytes versus 31 bytes which makes the data payload of the 4.2 version rated at 20 bytes max. This is a major distance and data transmission increase in performance. I notice it when I lay down my phone and walk away and my Apple Watch 3 is still connected when before I would lose connection with my older iPhone.The phone is designed to be IP67 for splash, water and dust resistant. The camera is still 12 MP but it has excellent performance with optical zoom and digital zoom up to 10 times. It also still has the portrait camera mode with the blurred background Bokeh effect by using both of the rear cameras. It even uses the new portrait lighting mode to make your photos look more professional.In the video recording mode I really like the 4K video recording with 30 or 60 fps.  Of course you still have the front facing camera with 7MP quality for face time or selfie photography. The slow motion mode is nice when shooting sports events or shooting wildlife videos.The phone is slightly larger but is still fits into most of your iPhone 7 Plus cases. The new iPhone 8 Plus weighs just a bit more at 7.12 ounces versus 6.63 ounces.  The battery life is the same in the specs but for me it seems to be a bit longer at 22.4 hours. The rating is 21 hours.The new phone is only available in 64 GIG or 256 GIG storage capacity.Overall this is a great phone. I am happy with our new phones and it is a good upgrade in power and performance."
"Amazon" "I love this phone! I upgraded from an iPhone 7. I would have to say this is one of the best iPhones I have ever had, and I upgrade every year. The camera is bomb.com. The portrait mode is pretty cool, and even the front facing camera seems to be more clear, (less grainy). The screen is brighter, the true tone display really makes a difference on the screen. This phone is way faster than my 7. The speakers are louder also. This phone has a lot of the same specs as the upcoming iPhone x, but still feels like an iPhone. I was going to get the x, but decided that I would wait until the next generation of that phone.  If you can get most of the same specs as iPhone x for less, combined with the familiarity and reliability of the iPhone we are used to, why not do that?"
"Amazon" "Worth the upgrade from my 6Plus, but what were they thinking by taking away the headphone jack? You can't charge the phone and use your headphones at the same time, unless you use a wireless charging pad, which you can't use if you use those magnetic car phone holders (if you cover the spot).  The camera is better than my 6Plus, so is the battery. Love the extra Ram and processing power. Just don't understand the lunacy of getting rid of the headphone jack.I'm also not a fan of iOS11. The update added extra wording that eats into Messages, and other screen areas. You can't click on an address and have it map it like it did in the 6 and 6S.You can't have your phone plugged in the car to charge and use for directions and use headphones. You get to have everyone hear all the map updates or Waze announcements.There is no way I'd upgrade from 7 to an 8 unless you just wanted the extra GB of RAM and faster processor.Buyer beware...."
"Amazon" "Much faster than my 6Plus however the lack of a built in 3.5mm cable is very annoying. If you misplace your adapter like I did you may end up stuck on a 15 hour plane ride with no tunes or videos!!! It's disappointing that they have moved all of their phones but the cheapest model to no 3.5. I'm a long time Apple fan boy but may have to switch when this one dies as I NEED the 3.5 jack!!!!!!!!!!! BTW I tried several of the Bluetooth headphones to include the AirPods and they all are horrible in my opinion and is just another item I have to charge. My wired earbuds/headphones always work as long as the phone has power."
"Amazon" "TechnoMaster sent me a great iPhone 8plus, new and crossed many thousands of international roads but got  me the product unlike that dung pile KWIRELESS, heathens.Wow, update. I’ve never owned anything this nice in my life like the iPhone 8 Plus. You can play for days on end with the camera and have the same photo technology as professionals. The camera in the phone working along with an app for tilt and shift produces like 😵.Everything on the case is glass. I can’t dream of a drop and looking for a good case."
"Amazon" "Go to the Apple store save a couple hundred dollars on the same phone and it’s unlocked forever with a better warranty! 2 stars cause good phone bad price"
"Amazon" "I \"upgraded\" from an LG G5 Android phone to an iPhone 8 Plus running iOS 11.0.3. Some things were better and some were not.While my family has had many Android and iOS devices, the iOS devices cost more but generally get (much) more use, plus they hold their value better. My favorite Android device (which has gotten a lot of use) has been my phone (an LG G2, then G4, then G5).UPDATE: I ended up returning the iPhone 8 Plus and getting a Pixel 2. There was just too much missing from iOS and the iPhone that Android had plus I was disappointed with the camera. I think the iPhone 8 is a decent phone but it's not for me (even though I use iPads). Read below for more.TIP: Don't buy mobile phones from Best Buy as they charge restocking fees.Hardware comparisons: * The G5 was much cheaper than the iPhone. * The G5 has a user replaceable battery and microSD slot. * The G5 is not waterproof but the iPhone is. * The G5 has dual cameras and one is a wide angle lens... I will miss the wide angle lens. * The G5 has fast charging and includes the needed cable and power adapter to do so. The iPhone 8 supposedly also has fast charging, but it will cost you $$$ to buy the needed cable and power adapter. * The G5 has a small color charge/notification LED which is nice. The iPhone can use the flash for alerts (General->Accessibility->LED Flash for Alerts). * The G5 photo aspect ratio is 16:9 and the iPhone's is 4:3. I *MUCH* prefer 16:9. Disappointed. * My G5 developed a focusing problem with the main camera where photos would often be blurry, which is what prompted me to start researching new phones. * The iPhone 8 Plus also has dual cameras, but no wide-angle camera... however, you get a 2X optical zoom camera and portrait mode photos which I am looking forward to. * The iPhone 8 has (slow) wireless charging but the G5 does not. * The iPhone 8 has 3D Touch but the G5 does not. * The iPhone feels like high end hardware, has a great IPS screen, and has great build quality but it's a little on the heavy side. The G5 is good too but doesn't seem quite up to the iPhone. * The glass back worries me but Consumer Reports says it is a rugged phone and survived their \"tough 100 drops in the tumbler with just some minor scratches\".iOS/iPhone negatives: * Speech recognition is not as advanced but it's not terrible either. * Speech recognition does not give you options to choose from a list of phrases of what you might have said. * I found it virtually impossible to place the cursor in the middle of a word when editing text. Very annoying. * Sometimes when I tap something it doesn't respond and I have to tap it again. This seems to happen mostly on small buttons. I didn't have this issue on the G5. * No always on display feature to show time and notifications. Many Android phones have had this for awhile, including the G5. Hopefully Apple will add this in an update as it's a very useful and convenient feature. * Can't configure bottom row of touch buttons. On Android, I had a button to quickly show and hide notifications. I found it better and faster than having to swipe down. * It seems Apple does not allow custom keyboards to access voice dictation... which means you have to switch keyboards to the standard one in order to access voice dictation. I use voice dictation a lot on my Android. * Home screen is not as configurable. Cannot control icon layout as much. * Some of my favorite apps (frequently used) are not available on iOS, like NOAA Weather and ColorNote. * You can turn on 'Reduce Motion' to limit animations that slow things down, but there are still some fades and other effects that you can't turn off. Android lets you turn off all (or almost all) \"eye candy\" animations for a faster phone. * Sharing photos to Google Drive made me always select the same folder (it didn't remember the selected folder).iOS/iPhone positives: * Frequent iOS updates. This is a big deal compared to most Android phones. * Easier to communicate with other people who also have iPhones (and there are a lot of them). * Can say \"Hey Siri\" to access Siri even when phone is laying down idle and without touching it. * Better security (so I've read). * Good integration across iPhones and iPads. * I like the way that news is integrated.So I returned the iPhone and bought a Pixel 2 because I like Android better when it comes to phones (although for tablets I use iPads).I really like the Pixel 2 but the LG G5 was great too although it did have some significant disadvantages (like updates).Pixel 2 notes: * It was very easy to connect my LG G5 to the Pixel 2 using the included cable to transfer data from my old phone to the new phone. There's also an included adapter in case you need it. Unfortunately I was disappointed that my alarms did not transfer and I had to re-enter them manually. I also had to re-arrange the icons the way I wanted. * The Pixel 2 screen and phone itself are a little smaller than my G5. I'd like a little larger screen like the G5 has but then the phone would be larger and weigh more so it's a trade-off. * No bloatware or crapware (especially the type you can't uninstall)!!! YEAH! And guaranteed 3 years of updates! These are BIG advantages of having Google phones. * So far the camera is impressing me. It's definitely better than the iPhone 8 Plus camera. I will still miss the wide angle camera on the G5 and the native 16:9 aspect ratio but portrait mode and the overall photo quality makes it much easier to forget. UPDATE: I noticed a quirk in portrait mode processing that didn't apply the blur properly around someone's hair... hopefully that will be improved/fixed. * Can turn off animations - I like to do this to make the phone feel even faster: https://lifehacker.com/disable-animations-on-android-to-improve-performance-1583554900 * The phone seems very fast, even when it was installing a bunch of apps in the background. It's the fastest and smoothest phone I've ever used. * The sound form the front-firing stereo speakers is best I've heard from a mobile phone. * I wasn't too happy there was no headphone jack, but I was pleasantly surprised that the headphone adapter seemed to be less intrusive than I anticipated and I am pretty certain that the sound quality through the adapter (which has a DAC in it) sounds better than my LG G5. I'll probably pick up an extra adapter or 2 (they are only $9 each) but are out of stock right now in the Google Store. Good audio video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pi_SykMCsI * The always on display looks great with OLED, and this is a really nice feature that you don't get on iPhone. * I like that you can change icon shapes (square, circle, \"squircle\", etc.). * I found out my mobile data wasn't working. After a few hours researching and messing with stuff, I ended up having to use a new Tracfone SIM and getting my service transferred to the new SIM. * The Pixel 2 has a 'Now Playing' feature that listens to any music that's playing nearby and tells you the name and artist (even on the always-on display), but I'm not sure how practical it is. By the way, it works without mobile data and WiFi and without sending audio to Google. UPDATE: I went to Target and my phone was identifying the background music Target was playing. Pretty cool, especially if you've ever wondered what a song is that was playing. * Fast charging is great (especially when you need it), and the Pixel 2 includes a beefy fast charger. * I really like that Google increased the warranty to 2 years. With the extra 24 months I get with my credit card, that gives me a 4 year warranty. Too bad it doesn't cover accidental damage though. * The Google Assistant is tops when it comes to brains (smarts), and can be activated with a squeeze or by saying 'hey Google' or 'OK Google'.Pixel 2 Android disappointments (could be rectified with Android updates): * No battery life indicator on the 'always on' display (my G5 had this and it was useful). * My LG lets you customize the navigation bar but the Pixel 2 doesn't without a little \"hacking\" it seems. I really liked that I could add an extra button to pull down the notifications. Maybe they will add this in Oreo 8.1. * There is a double-tap feature to check your phone but unfortunately you can't double tap it to turn the screen back off (my G5 had this too)... this one is kind of nitpicky though."
"Amazon" "Purchased this directly from Apple store.  Upgraded from iPhone 5s 64gb.  If you're Apple person, almost no learning curb.  Price though is stratospheric though cheaper than iPhone X.Unit is blazing fast compared to my old iPhone.  Screen is not OLED but still look wonderful with True Tone feature.  Lost use of some software because developers did not upgrade their software from 32-bit to 64-bit.  Speaker sound is much improved and really it is pleasure to listen while watching movie.  Even though optical zoom is only 2x, it is nice to have.  Digital zoom will go up to 10x but you pay in term of graininess.Guts are virtually same as iPhone X.  Probably the last of \"old-style\" iPhone and most perfect in term of integration of software and hardware.Will do wireless charging but you'll have to pony up xtra money for charger and stand.  Unfortunately, it will not fast charge like some Samsung android smart phone.Best to invest in good case and screen protector as unit has glass back (to facilitate wireless charging)."
"Amazon" "did you said fully unlocked。and when i open the iphone the SIM is lock！"
"Amazon" "I hate mine... After one day calls would studder and no one could hear me."
"Amazon" "Bought and receive it as specified. However, this guys do not take their job seriously. Therefore, \"IT SAYS UNLOCKED\" plus \"FULLY\", but it seems that is just a joke. Phone came with a SPRINT Sim card, and my carrier, which is T-Mobile, did not work on it, it said \"Not compatible\". Advise, DO NOT PLAY WITH PEOPLE'S TIME and MONEY. Specially, in Christmas."
"Amazon" "Easy to use. The speed is quick to open and search things. Still have to figure some things out."
"Amazon" "I still could not prove it because they give it to me in December but apparently everything Ok 😁 the shipment arrived before the agreement, very good. Recommended!"
"Amazon" "Was perfect but was stolen"
"Amazon" "I \"upgraded\" from an LG G5 Android phone to an iPhone 8 Plus running iOS 11.0.3. Some things were better and some were not.While my family has had many Android and iOS devices, the iOS devices cost more but generally get (much) more use, plus they hold their value better. My favorite Android device (which has gotten a lot of use) has been my phone (an LG G2, then G4, then G5).UPDATE: I ended up returning the iPhone 8 Plus and getting a Pixel 2. There was just too much missing from iOS and the iPhone that Android had plus I was disappointed with the camera. I think the iPhone 8 is a decent phone but it's not for me (even though I use iPads). Read below for more.TIP: Don't buy mobile phones from Best Buy as they charge restocking fees.Hardware comparisons: * The G5 was much cheaper than the iPhone. * The G5 has a user replaceable battery and microSD slot. * The G5 is not waterproof but the iPhone is. * The G5 has dual cameras and one is a wide angle lens... I will miss the wide angle lens. * The G5 has fast charging and includes the needed cable and power adapter to do so. The iPhone 8 supposedly also has fast charging, but it will cost you $$$ to buy the needed cable and power adapter. * The G5 has a small color charge/notification LED which is nice. The iPhone can use the flash for alerts (General->Accessibility->LED Flash for Alerts). * The G5 photo aspect ratio is 16:9 and the iPhone's is 4:3. I *MUCH* prefer 16:9. Disappointed. * My G5 developed a focusing problem with the main camera where photos would often be blurry, which is what prompted me to start researching new phones. * The iPhone 8 Plus also has dual cameras, but no wide-angle camera... however, you get a 2X optical zoom camera and portrait mode photos which I am looking forward to. * The iPhone 8 has (slow) wireless charging but the G5 does not. * The iPhone 8 has 3D Touch but the G5 does not. * The iPhone feels like high end hardware, has a great IPS screen, and has great build quality but it's a little on the heavy side. The G5 is good too but doesn't seem quite up to the iPhone. * The glass back worries me but Consumer Reports says it is a rugged phone and survived their \"tough 100 drops in the tumbler with just some minor scratches\".iOS/iPhone negatives: * Speech recognition is not as advanced but it's not terrible either. * Speech recognition does not give you options to choose from a list of phrases of what you might have said. * I found it virtually impossible to place the cursor in the middle of a word when editing text. Very annoying. * Sometimes when I tap something it doesn't respond and I have to tap it again. This seems to happen mostly on small buttons. I didn't have this issue on the G5. * No always on display feature to show time and notifications. Many Android phones have had this for awhile, including the G5. Hopefully Apple will add this in an update as it's a very useful and convenient feature. * Can't configure bottom row of touch buttons. On Android, I had a button to quickly show and hide notifications. I found it better and faster than having to swipe down. * It seems Apple does not allow custom keyboards to access voice dictation... which means you have to switch keyboards to the standard one in order to access voice dictation. I use voice dictation a lot on my Android. * Home screen is not as configurable. Cannot control icon layout as much. * Some of my favorite apps (frequently used) are not available on iOS, like NOAA Weather and ColorNote. * You can turn on 'Reduce Motion' to limit animations that slow things down, but there are still some fades and other effects that you can't turn off.

"Amazon" "Snappy. Expensive. Camera Fantastic. iOS 11 very productive. True tone display easy on the eye. Wireless charging is awesome!I have a Note 8 and iPhone 8 Plus. Note 8 has many features and I love most, particularly Samsung Pay which works at way more places than Apple Pay does. Stylus is good to scribble stuff. Display is fantastic. iPhone 8 Plus with its execution (app performance) and Apple Watch Series 2 experience trumps Note 8 W/ Frontier S3 Watch.My old iPhone 7 Plus leather case from Apple worked just fine. The fast chargers I use with Note 8 work just fine with iPhone 8 Plus with the case on. This is my most favorite feature so far. True tone display and the snappy cameras with portrait lighting gives the extra edge over Note 8.iOS 11 is snappy. Migration of data from iPhone 7 Plus was made lot easy & quick with the new Apple Watch like transfer feature.All in all, great for productivity seekers, fashion statement & everything in between."

"Amazon" "BEWARE!99% of the negative reviews are SELLER REVIEWS! People bought used products or from a private seller and got something not covered by amazon. BUY NEW, FROM AMAZON. If you don't know how to shop, I suggest you double check where the item is coming from in your cart and before you check out. PAY ATTENTION!After owning the phone long enough to be familiar with it, I thought I would leave a decent review outlining some of the pro's and con's, as well as some neutral's. My review is as follows: (see end comments about unlocked and verizon use - this phone is 100% unlocked!)Pro's:1. Very sleek design. Very nice screen and overall a great phone.2. The camera/video recorder is AMAZING. Simple as that. I took amazing outdoor and indoor (even in low light/no light) pictures. I am genuinely impressed and was not expecting it to be so good. (See last pic. Photo on phone was taken by s8)3. The pixel ratio/screen size. I got the s8 because I did not want a huge computer in my pocket, and it has plenty of room in it.4. Very fast. The processor even with battery settings set to a mid level (which can be changed to your personal preference) is still fast enough to do anything you can throw at it.5. RAM and Storage ration. Perfect. Plenty of ram to handle multi-tasking and plenty of storage to handle those 4k videos/pictures PLUS room to expand with SD storage, which is also getting much better and bigger. But 64GB entry level... eat your heart out apple.6. Great speaker! I mean wow... this thing get's loud. I was also not expecting such great sound. You will have no trouble hearing anything even in a loud environment. Seriously amazed here.7. Power saving/Battery life. Simply put, the AMOLED allows for some amazing battery life and the 3000mah batter holds up well. Very well. Much better than the iPhone.8. Fast charging. The lowest I have had the battery is about 60% and it charged in under an hour.9. AMOLED screen. As stated in #7, it helps with battery life but other than that, it has plenty of brightness and picture clarity. I also carified in #3 that the screen size and pixel ratio were simply stunning. You will notice this if you game alot or during those 4k picture zooms and probably much more on the s8+.10. Accessories and headphone jack. It has a headphone jack! lol. The accessories that came with the phone are great. A fast charging cable, a type-c to mini usb extension, and a usb to type-c extension as well. The headphones are simply amazing too. By far some of the best I have owned, as far as ear buds go, and you don't have to pay for good quality here. The material of them is great and they come with extra different size earbuds.11. Water resistance. While I have not tested it, and probably never will, it's a great feature. I still don't recommend dunking your phone.12. Pocket settings. There is an option to keep the screen off while in your pocket, or something like a purse. Simple as that. If you butt dial, you probably are not navigating the settings well enough. Keep in mind, android has A LOT of settings, and it would be wise to go through them all including the basic options that samsung offers.13. Widget size. You can actually adjust the size of every single widget, and fit more apps on the pages as well as the default home row. You can also change the lock screen apps, if you want any at all. I personally have a camera and the phone app on the lock screen, and keep all my apps on a single page, in folders, the weather, a google search bar with the mic button, and lastly a control panel for quick access to bluetooth and auto-sync buttons etc etc.. All on one page, with plenty of empty space. Half the screen is even still empty. Thank you so much for resizeable widgets.Neutral:1. Bixby button. The button is below the volume buttons, so nothing you can do there. However, you can disable bixby. Most reviews on here are failing to realize this and also failing to outline how. See the end of my review for simple instructions.2. Phone Length. I'll admit, it's pretty long. Maybe I am just to used to an older, smaller phone, but one handed operations is going to take some getting used to. Be mindful of the edges of the screen too. Too much palm and you will be scrolling. I do not see this as a negative still, just takes some getting used to and as outlined in the pro's section, the overall screen size is perfect.3. Edge lighting. A bit torn on this one. It seems cool, but is pretty much useless. It's basically a notification before the notification. So you would have to tap twice and then unlock as well. IMHO, it does look really cool, but SAMSUNG needs to give us more control over it.4. Always on display. This can also be turned off. I find it 100% useless, but not a negative by any means. I feel it can definitely cater to some users who enjoy always being able to look at their phone. I personally disabled it and honestly looked no further into it.5. Color settings. I have always disliked samsung's default colors. Especially on TV's. However, there is an option to change them to your liking. I chose the basic setting, but there is even an option to change balance which let's you arrange a set of liked color boxes, whites, and blacks to your liking and all kinds of other options for personal preference. It really is a great setting, however, it is a neutral and not a pro simply because they enable a very rich color by default. So I recommend changing this to suite your own eyeballs.6. The lock screen clock/theme settings. In order to change the lock screen clock, you have to register with samsung themes and install a theme, which can be somewhat custom. I did this, and the deactivated my account. The setting were retained and all is well. Still a neutral because I feel samsung should incorporate a way to change the lock screen clock by default to a couple preset clocks. The standard one IMHO, is ugly and not aesthetically pleasing to read.Con's:1. Typical android settings. Everything is always on. This is not a samsung issue, but android. I recommend going through every single option, and every single app to change every single setting. Sometimes, this can take the first week of owning an android phone to get right. This also almost always has a HUGE impact on battery life. There are settings in sub-menu's of settings. So please, NAVIGATE YOUR ANDROID SETTINGS! Your poor battery life is not due to this phone at all. It is due to negligence and laziness.2. \"Ok Google\". This seems to always be on, even when turned off in googles settings. I have a search bar and I have turned off all settings both in the phone and google, but for some reason if you say those two naughty words, it still comes up. However, if you do not set it up, it will only be asking you to set it up. Same thing as bixby almost, but this is a negative because I do not want my mic on. At all. I think samsung needs to address this before anything else, even the bixby issues some people are not liking or failing to change.3. All glass. The phone is not strong by any means. It does not feel like a cheap POS, but it is all glass. This belongs in the negative because most of us are drop prone, and even if you are not, it is very easy to make a mistake. Overall, it looks amazing, but there is no need for a glass backing too. I highly recommend you get a case, and if you are in fact drop prone, get a big durable case like an otterbox with a screen protector. The risk will always be there with all smart phones, but the s8 being all glass just seems pointless. That said, I have NEVER dropped a phone to a point where it broke (fingers crossed, knock on wood).4. The finger print scanner. What a stupid placement for a finger print scanner. Right next to the camera lense? come on... I personally do not use it at all, but if I did and wanted to take a picture, you would be cleaning your lense as soon as you unlocked it. Nobody wants to take an unclear photo because they used the finger print security feature. I like the Google Plus one, but feel that if any, Apple has the best one being in the home button.On a side note: THIS PHONE IS UNLOCKED. It can be used with ANY carrier. If you do not pay attention to who or where you buy it from, at least leave a sellers review instead of a product review. 99% of the negative reviews are this. Please pay attention and buy a new phone from Amazon only. I do not ever recommend getting a refurb on this kind of product, or buying from a private seller regardless of their rating. You just never know.As for Bixby, all you have to do is not set it up and hold the home screen like you are adding a widget, scroll to the left and hit the button to turn it off. This will not remove it, but will stop it from doind whatever crazy stuff these other reviews are talking about. I have had NO ISSUES with bixby, because I turned it off. Also, make sure you go through your settings, including the subsettings imbedded into android like background data usage etc etc and turn it all off. People having battery issues, I guarantee it is not the s8's fault. It is android and you would not get any better life with iOS for failing to go through your settings. GO THROUGH YOUR SETTINGS! every. single. one. Over and over for a week until you find every nook and cranny. There is a lot!Overall, this phone is amazing. The list of pro's, con's, and neutral's are simply my take and my opinion. I do recommend the phone. At least if you are in a position to think about it and can try it, go to a local store and pick one up on the display to play with it, but it's just not the same as owning it. I was torn between a google pixel xl and this one, but when this dropped in price it made my decision that much easier. I did like the idea of a bigger phone, however, I just kept thinking how big it would be in my pocket. So I went with the standard s8 and I am very happy I did. I do a lot of fishing, hiking, and outdoor stuff and 90% of the time, I TRY to keep my phone around me in my pocket in case of an emergency. Usually off, because where I go there is no signal anyways.Any review stating a mostly negative opinion, in my opinion, is probably a bit trollish or did not do any research and made an impulse buy. I think you can get used to this phone and if you are complaining about the things I have outlined here, the only one to blame is you. So give it a try, navigate ALL the settings, get used to android, and don't drop this phone lol! Thank you for reading."
"Amazon" " So far the best phone I ever had. Man it's beautiful. Sleek design and powerful hardware. I did a comparison with my old phone and you certainly can feel that it's more powerful. I'm not used to it yet. But it does everything perfectly. The picture quality is superb. I love shooting video and it nails it in video quality and it does slow motion!! say whaaaat!! But sometimes it overheats under the direct sun when I record video but I think that is normal. I don't use the fingerprint sensor only because I can't find it. And the mono speaker under the phone is a downside which most of the time I cover it with my little finger and it's kinda annoying. Other than that it's freaking fast and top notch phone. I don't regret buying it .Make sure to check out the video and pictures and if my review was helpful please press YES for helpful. Thank you"
"Amazon" "I was skeptical about buying this phone off Amazon instead of Verizon because the reviews were half good, half bad as far as activating it on the Verizon network.  My advice is dont go to the store and activate yourself on their website.  It takes just 5-10 minutes.  Just make sure to have a Verizon nano SIM card, I was able to use the one from my iphone 6.  Transfer your contacts, music etc on their app as well, it's very easy.  Other than that the actual phone is great.  Very sleek looking phone.  This phone is $756 at Verizon and they try to sell their payment plan to you but I would much rather pay the cheaper Amazon price and keep my phone bill lower.  If you're on the fence like I was I hope this review can help you out."
"Amazon" "This phone should be a no-brainer. Easily the most stunning display ever on a phone, great specs, Samsung Pay, expandable storage, and waterproofing SHOULD make this the best phone on the market. Enter Samsung's software. While Touchwiz isn't nearly the raging dumpster fire it was back in the S4 and S5 days, there's still a lot of extras that most will consider junk. Chief among these is Bixby. Have you ever wondered what Siri would be like if it were dumber and had a dedicated hardware button? That's Bixby. Not content to let Google do the heavy lifting, Samsung's MO continues to be creating inferior versions of services already offered by Big G. Want to remap that button to something actually useful? Too bad. Samsung keeps patching the phone in order to force their bloatware down your throat. As it is, that's a dead button that you'll press once out of curiosity, and a few dozen times while trying to turn down the volume. One other annoyance of note is the horrible placement of the fingerprint scanner. There's just no excuse for this one.Overall, it's a great phone that's held back by Samsung's usual goofball decisions."
"Amazon" "I haven't owned a Galaxy phone since the Galaxy Nexus.I've always felt that Samsung's Touch Wiz UI was too gimmicky and looked cartoon-ish.This is my 5th phone in the last 6 months. I was coming from a Nexus 6P, One Plus 3T, Axon 7 and LG V20.I really liked the LG V20 for it's cameras and the Axon 7 for it's front facing speakers. The 6P and One Plus 3Twere so smooth. But I decided to trade it all in for the S8.I was initially going to get a Google Pixel, but prices were still high and besides the camera, not much appealed to me.The S8 is a damn sexy phone with over 80% of the front being the screen. I like the size. Fits perfectly in my hands.I don't think I will go back to a 6\" phablet phone. The screen is vibrant. The clear flip cover case works well with it too.Touch Wiz has been toned down from what I remember, but there is still a lot of bloatware, which I quickly disabled.I guess I like all the screen shot options this phone has to offer. You take screen shot many ways, annotate, make gifs, etc.Charging is pretty fast and the battery lasts me all day. The included headphones are really good. Can't go wrong with AKG. They look cheap, but they sound superb. I'm using Face Unlock, it's really fast. I have my finger print set up too, but face unlock is faster and more convenient. I guess someone can always hold up a picture right? (Haven't tried it yet) The finger print sensor takes a little bit to get used to. My finger naturally goes to the where the camera is located and you need to fully press on the sensor to get it to unlock.They should move the camera to the corner like some phones.USB-C is awesome.Bluethooth 5 is Awesome. You can now stream to 2 separate bluetooth speakers at the same time (one will have a slight delay though).I have a few gripes.Even though it has a F1.7 aperture the camera is not wide angle. It does take really good pictures and videos.My other gripe is the single speaker. C'mon... it's 2017.... all Flagship phones should have stereo speakers.Get rid of Bixby. Let us just use Google Assist.By default the phone display is set to 2220X1080, which is fine for me. You can always set it to WQHD (2960X1440). I'm not sure how much more battery the phone will be using if you did. I still like that Samsung lets you put a SD card it it and it comes with a OTG adapter so you can plug in other USB sticks too. The Edge panel is just ok. Still getting used to it. I can live without it.This phone has tons of other features too, but I'm not going to list them all. Overall, it's the best smart phone I've ever owned. Hopefully it holds up well over the next 2 years."
"Amazon" "I've been getting Samsung phones since the Galaxy S1. But when I got this phone the Bixby feature was a minor problem. After a month its gotten even more annoying the fact Bixby would come up and whats worse, is we can NOT reprogram or disable that button. Later on I realized there was a lot of other crap-ware Samsung was forcing on us that would popup up as well. The worst was when I wanted to take a video and yours truly Bixby vision came up and I missed the shot. There are other problems but all were minor what bothers me is the amount of small problems. Unless in the next Galaxy Samsung stops forcing crap-ware onto their phones this is the last Samsung phone I would ever get."
"Amazon" "Amazing phone. Just about every thing of this phone is better than the top end of iPhones. Better screen. More memory. Expansion slot. Better form. +Fingerprint sensor. Great iris sensor, and a good face detection. Better software controls because unlike iOS, android gives you a lot of control over so many aspects of user experience.I used to be an iPhone user for many years but finally got bored of the lackluster hardware, and being dictated what I should want from my phone. I use a standard ear phones, and expect my phone to honor my wishes."
"Amazon" "I ordered this on Black Friday and after waiting a few weeks it arrived. I didn't expect to actually enjoy an Android based phone, but I was pleasantly surprised. My carrier fully supports this phone and I consistently get maximum speeds in my city (150/20). At home I get gigabit wifi. It was a little weird to look at the curved sides, but I got used to it after about 2 days. I highly recommend the OtterBox Defender case because this phone, like many others, is a bit too thin for large hands."
"Amazon" "Nice size, getting used to it's function. Just a bit different from my Windows phone, which was very easy to use, just very buggie after the recent OS update. Nice display, quick function, just a bit of a challenge to navigate around the phone. Imbedded apps are a pain, and slow the phone down. Google got it right with their Pixel 2. Aftermarket products are hit-or-miss for the S8, as many cases for this aren't very snug-fitting. READ the reviews for cases and accessories. Some really suck."
"Amazon" "1.- I bought the \"Phone Only\", this Amazon description makes it look or sound like you are buying a phone on a plastic bag or something,  but it comes in a nice box, with AWG (?) headphones, a pair of extra ear plugs, wall charger with USB cable, a USB adapter and a tool to pop up the phones SD/SIM card comparment.2.- A regular USB micro cable will not fit, but it comes with an adapter.It feels really good in my hand, I bought a Zizo Bolt case that comes with a glass protector.(see pics)More to come later , but I'm a Samsung guy, so I know what to expect, but I'll post an update once i get to use it a little bit more."
"Amazon" "Love the phone.  The all glass aspect and some of the reviews alarmed at first but after using it with a good case for minimal coverage but maximum protection it is all good.  The phone has great features and new technology, the screen is wonderful, video’s are a whole new experience, great speaker, good speaker just can’t say enough about this wonderful product."
"Amazon" "The phone itself works fine with great colors and reasonably fast. Take excellent pictures and videos and all in all would buy it again. My biggest negative is that for some reason within two weeks of having this phone it crashed and unfortunately I had just taken about 60 pictures that day which never made it to the cloud and I lost them all. Very disappointing."
"Amazon" "I upgraded to this phone from a ZTE Zmax Pro.  This phone is incredible to any phone I have ever had.  It is very fast and reliable.  It's very well build and sturdy.  I had problems with other phones in my area with my carrier and with this phone, I have not experienced any issues with my signal.  Highly recommend."
"Amazon" "I am extremely satisfied with this phone. Had no issues activating it with my current Verizon account. Just went to the retailer for a free SIM card and they set everything up. One thing that I wished I had known prior to purchasing this was that with an unlocked phone you will  not have voicemail notifications. This is software that is installed by carriers onto the carrier specific phones. The only way you will know if you have voicemail is to call your mailbox. There are some apps available to download so this really isn't an issue. I just wish I had known about this so I wouldnt have missed some messages."
"Amazon" "Works well with armor case.  I applied with case on to get an exact fit.  Bubbles disappeared within 2 days to leave a completely transparent voating..  So far protector has stayed on without issue for nine days.  I like the texture and touch sensitivity is gone."
"Amazon" "Really bad service from Samsung. The phone came with a defect in the front camera. I called them and they told me it will be fixed when the phone updates to the new version. I was back and forward with Samsung since I notice the issue. I noted first when I made my first skype meeting call. Then when my colleges told me about the issue, I started taking selfies, I notice that all the selfies have the same black spot in the same place. Unfortunately, I figured out the issue 36 days after I bout this phone from Amazon. So, I  could not return the phone due to the 30 days return policy.I contacted Samsung, they asked me to update and reset the phone and so a bunch of staff to the camera app. After the 2nd call, They sent me to a Repair Center close to my home. The repair center wanted to charge me $109 dollars. I called Samsung again. This time Samsung told me that because I was under warranty they can fix it for me. They cannot replace phones but just fix them. Samsung told me that they will take 11 days to fix it. I expressed my concern that I bought an expensive phone because the service as my work and my business depend on a reliable phone. I told them that I cannot afford 11 days without communication. So, they told me \"Well you won't be without communication you can buy a ship phone and exchange the sim card until your phone cames back\".So, does not Samsung understand that an unlock cheap phone cost at minimum 120 and it won't be able to multitask as fast I need to do my job and maintain my business?I do not recommend to buy this phone or any Samsung phone if service and reliability is the most important subject for your purchase."
"Amazon" "Got a new SIM card from my carrier and was instantly up and running. Very happy with the phone, face recognition is better than I expected.  Phone is very fast.  Battery life has been awesome."
"Amazon" "Love this phone. I was a little unsure about the curved screen at first but it I actually love the look and feel of it now. Upgraded from an s5 and the difference is amazing."
"Amazon" "To be honest, I purchased this phone June 5th and have had nothing but problems with it since I bought it. The biggest problem, the battery and charging problems. Every time I let the phone get to 40% or less battery life, and plug it in, it automatically just shuts down completely. Not sleep, not screen off, SHUT DOWN. It has been crazy annoying but i dealt with it since it is the \"best phone out there\".Next, the always on screen. Sometimes it is literally ALWAYS ON. screen is on, at the main home screen, not the lock screen. Anyone can get into the phone, browse away and make calls if I a not watching. Also, in this state, if it isn't charging and I put it in my pocket, it actually heats my leg uncomfortably. The only solution is to hit the power button to put it to the lock screen. Very frustrating but I dealt with it because it is \"the best phone out there\".Now this morning i awoke to find the phone powered off. I assume the battery had dies so I plugged it in. Normally, as soon as it is plugged in you would see a circle with a lightning bolt inside that appears, letting you know it is at zero percent but it is charging. The LED light would also blink at the top....nothing. No LED light, no circle with lightning bolt, nothing. I then proceeded to spend 3 hours looking on the internet, calling Samsung, everything to try and rectify the issue. It just will not turn on.So now I get on the phone with Samsung and they have me go through 20 minutes of attempts to resolve the issue, the same things I just spent 3 hours trying. Still nothing. I also read in their warranty for cell phones (see attached screenshot) that \"During the applicable warranty period, provided the Product is returned in accordance with the terms of this Standard Limited Warranty, Samsung will repair or replace the Product, at Samsung’s sole option, without charge.\" So i figured they would just ask the woman to overnight a replacement of this 5 month old phone and I would ship this broken one back, done....nope. The woman on the phone refused to even acknowledge replacing was an option even though I read her word for word what the warranty stated. The only option was to send it to them, wait for them to fix it, and then send it back. All of which will take 2 weeks! I replacement can be shipped in 2 days!. I asked her nicely again to replace it as I cannot be without a phone for 2 weeks, no; she wouldn't even consider it since she didn't believe it was in the warranty in the first place. After a 3rd try to get her to understand she simply got quiet as she refused to even discuss it with me any longer. Very disrespectful and lack of understanding of my situation or their warranty apparently  but also very disrespectful to a customer who has spent a fortune on Samsung products.So now I am sending the phone back to Samsung to let them spend 2 weeks to repair and send it back. In the interim I plan to buy another phone THAT WILL NOT BE SAMSUNG. I have been a Samsung fan for 4 years now and have spent close to $20,000 on phones, TVs, all new kitchen appliances. To be so mistreated after all of this loyalty is unbelievable. After tolerating all of nuisances with this phone and then to be told they cannot replace it but it must be sent in for repair for 2 weeks is just unacceptable. This is the reason why Samsung has peaked for me and will now be going downhill. As far I am concerned there will never be another Samsung product in my home and I will actively tell whoever will listen to stay away from this company who does not respect their customers loyalty.Unless this company makes this right I will get the phone back ,sell it and never even consider another Samsung product, period. The aggravation alone is worth 10 of these phones that cost Samsung less than 300 dollars to manufacturer. Losing a 20k customer is going to hurt. Further I plan to post this review anywhere I can so that as many people considering Samsung products understand the company and lack of customer focus."
"Amazon" "KNOWN ISSUES WITH TEXTING - read the Samsung forums before buying this phone. I sent my 2 month old phone in for repair when it stopped sending texts after a security update, and it was supposedly repaired but is still not working! Tech support and Sales pointed fingers at one another and have given me the runaround and refused a refund. Hard to believe Samsung hasn't improved their customer support after the S7 debacle. So far I've wasted hundreds of dollars on a paperweight and hours of my time on the phone with Samsung. Buy a reliable but inexpensive Moto G5 plus instead if you require texting capabilities on your phone!"
"Amazon" "The features are alright, but nothing amazing. The Bixby button is just in the way and almost wholly useless. No screen protectors will stay on the damn thing and my screen was broken within 3 weeks because my kid leaned on the sofa and it slid onto my floor. My carpeted floor. This was a phone in an Otterbox case with a screen protector on (I believe it was the 3rd I'd purchased in just as many weeks since they don't stay on.). I took it in since I paid for insurance and they wanted to charge me my firstborn to give me a refurb phone. I decided to call around and it's about $500 for a replacement screen.I'm not particularly hard on phones and always keep them in a case and with a protector because I don't like having to replace overpriced gadgets. The only time I've had a cracked screen in all my years of phone ownership was when the entire strap broke on my bag and my Note 4 wound up with a cracked corner from like 3 tons of books falling on it on a subway platform. If I had any idea that the entire screen would be spider veined from sliding off the front of my sofa onto carpet, there's NO way I'd have bought this. I'm not a fan of the curved edges at all and wish they had a flat version because I really do like Samsung products for the most part. This one, however, is just a dud. It's way too fragile (and repairs WAY too expensive) to be useful to everyday folks. I've gone back to my old phone for now because I can't afford to pay to have it fixed in a repair shop and even the $200 deductible on the insurance policy just isn't worth it for a device that will likely break again if falling 2 ft onto carpet is enough to send it to the ER."
"Amazon" "Does a perfect cell phone even exist?  This phone has some little annoying things about it.  Nothing too major I can think of right now.  One is the ugly emojis.  I liked the ones on my old Droid way better."
"Amazon" "our Verizon store had no problems with this at all. They had it up and running in no time"
"Amazon" "Awesome phone!!!Pros:Amazing (super amazing) displayawesome aesthetics (the phone is very sleek)lightweightCons:Awkward position for a fingerprint sensor.I heard screen breaks pretty easily (I ordered screen protector and a case for this phone, although my earlier phones didn't require one)"

"Amazon" "This was Christmas present for my son, that absolutely loves his new phone thank you."
"Amazon" "It’s great, I like it!!"
"Amazon" "i am having a hard time settin this up. The volume adjustment on incoming calls  is a problem."
"Amazon" "Excellent"
"Amazon" "Beautiful device. Item as described, brand new in untouched packaging. Set up was super easy, especially with the adapter to transfer data from my old phone."
"Amazon" "Great phone & user-friendly"
"Amazon" "What I like the most is the overall phone and all that it offers.  I gave it two stars because it lacks the critical functionality of Wi-Fi calling.  If this unlocked phone had Wi-Fi calling the I would have given it 5 stars."
"Amazon" "I have been using this for a couple of months and it really has impressed me on what it can do.  They were so many features I discovered that I did not know even existed like dual speakers and edge lighting.  This really is the best phone you can buy."
"Amazon" "The best cell phone in 2017, the battery is very good!"
"Amazon" "Phone appears to be great. However, I'm missing the ear buds, and phone charger and cable . I would like amazon to send those missing items, so I can use the phone."
"Amazon" "This Galaxy s8, is wonderful, there is none like this. Picture takes  from this phone is so clear as a crystal. You can use this phone for everything from A to Z. It\"s all about."
"Amazon" "The phone is what I expected from Samsung...this is my third Samsung and I have been very satisfied with them all."
"Amazon" "This phone is great except for the fact that the screen scratches incredibly easily.  Just going in and out of my pocket the phone shows a multitude of scratch marks running up both edges of the face and randomly across the front.  All I can say is that gorilla glass 5 is definitely not where it's at.  If the screen didn't scratch so easily I would definitely recommend this phone but because of it I would definitely wait for something else."
"Amazon" "Great price and works great"
"Amazon" "This phone is really good as described. it fits on my hand and edge display is awesome"
"Amazon" "This Phone is Unlocked for use on the Verizon Network, However Verizon has many of the Verizon based apps blocked.  This includes Verizon Voicemail, and Video calling."
"Amazon" "I was looking for a new phone and stumbled upon these S8s.I bought one and so far I am not regretting it."
"Amazon" "This phone is really saying something. I think it has taken me close to being able to junk all my other devices.  It is really, really good."
"Amazon" "Perfect purchase. No disappointments.. 5 stars."
"Amazon" "Don't get me wrong, the functionality of this phone is incredible. However, the phone might as well come with a broken screen. This is the first phone that I have ever broken. And within 3 months of owning it, I have broken the screen twice. Both times were low impact falls from heights of about 2 feet while sitting. Furthermore, it breaks through a case, which is even more baffling.The phone is absolutely beautiful out of the box but once it inevitably breaks, you're left with an item that you just paid $400 - $800 feeling like you're trying to wait out a contract until your next upgrade is available. It would be nice to just fix the screen that Samsung should honestly feel ashamed about but that costs $150 - $200 unless you do it yourself. And then you are right back at square one with a new fragile screen not suitable for a device that is considered \"mobile.\"I plan on coughing up the deductible to file an insurance claim on the phone. Mostly because the second break occurred in a way that a shard of glass is now impressing the screen preventing me from escaping a black screen while on a phone call. It otherwise works but I cannot look at texts/internet or even hang-up while taking a call.I would strongly advise against buying this phone. Even though I enjoyed my 3 months of use, I wish I had not bought it. Its pretty disappointing that Samsung is not remedying the fagility of this phone in mass. It's comical that a purchaser needs to constantly worry about a $200 bill while using this phone in a fairly standard way. The iPhone X is also a frightening phone since it looks like the same design. I would be exceedingly hesitant to buy anything that even remotely resembles this design in the future."
"Amazon" "Can't wait for the s9 to come out."
"Amazon" "Love this phone, completely unlocked. I can make a WiFi hotspot with it which is great. I use a straight talk sim card."
"Amazon" "Urgent Urgent urgent! DO NOT ORDER PHONE FROM ELECTRONIC DEALS. They are not real and their phones are locked not directly from Samsung factory. Careful people."
"Amazon" "Excellent phone, keypad too sensitive."
"Amazon" "Amazon came through again. No complaints EVER!"
"Amazon" "Everything was as expected. Nice phone."
"Amazon" "Everything works well. Recommend seller"

"Amazon" "Works great and is compatible with a pay-as-you-go plan. Camera is impressive, especially for night shots."
"Amazon" "Fantastic!!"
"Amazon" "No words , one of the best smart phone,  I recommend this than the iPhone s8s"
"Amazon" "Love it. Came in good condition. Just trying to learn all there is about it."
"Amazon" "Worth"
"Amazon" "Phone is super fast and reliable. Screen size is perfect for work and personal usage."
"Amazon" "Does NOT work with T-Mobile, it was compatible with Verizon when I received it. Just an FYI!"
"Amazon" "I know 5 people worth the S8 plus... Between the 5 of us we've had 6 (mine twice now) broken screens.  I'm very disappointed with how fragile this phone is.  Unless you get a cast that fully encases the phone and takes away the edge functionality, the phone will remain very susceptible to breakage.  Other than the screen breaking twice in two months... I love it!"
"Amazon" "Excellent"
"Amazon" "Best phone  I have had. Loved it"
"Amazon" "Wonderful device. Would buy from the seller again"
"Amazon" "I was satisfied with the design and the performance..."

"Amazon" " The video is a three (3.5) month review review of the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus smartphone. We take a look at the design, screen, Touch Wiz, OS, camera, video and audio playback and more. I've been using this as my daily driver and did my best to share my experience.The short version, if you don't want to watch the entire video - love it. One of the best looking phones out there with an awesome screen, camera, and overall performance. Plus it's water resistant and has tons of features."
"Amazon" "The camera is great but the phone itself....negative.  The glass on this phone is very fragile.  Even in a case this phone is fragile. Most cases cannot protect the infinity screen.  Visit Samungs website and go to the community forum and look for broken screens.  I wish I had before my purchase.  I shattered the back and it is costing me $70 to repair.  And of course if there is physical damage it voids the warranty.  So use super thin glass and then sit back and collect the repair money. I guess they had to make up for the Note 7 somehow."
"Amazon" "I have been using Samsung phones for 10 yrs.They have made advancements with the S8+, which I truly enjoy however there are too many draw backs for me.The bixby feature is awesome, it took a while to really get use out of bixby for me. You really have to use it in order for it to learn and be useful. I recommend setting it up and going through the prompts, play with it for an hour or two. Set up short cuts. I found that \"take me home\" phrase I used when asking the previous assistant Galaxy to navigate home, does not work on bixby unless you set up a short cut. I do not however like the button. I find myself accidentally hitting the button all the time which disrupts what I'm doing on my phone because then you must wait for the bixby home page to load before you may close out.Two major complaints:The battery. I was blown away by the battery life when I first got my S8+! I've read a lot about battery preservation so I do not charge my phone while I'm sleeping because leaving it on the charger when it's fully charged kills the battery longevity. So I charge a couple hours a day while I'm at work and that's it. I stream music in the car so I expected that to drain the battery quickly but it did not! After exactly 6 months of use, my phone now loses about 30/40% just sitting idle while I don't use it in just about 3 hours. When I noticed this draining battery issue I immediately took action. I deleted every app that I don't use on a weekly basis. I set up the power saving mode. I changed screen settings. It has helped a little bit but not enough to really make a difference. I now have to charge my phone constantly.Because of the very iPhone-esk style they took begining with the S7, the phone now has a glass back that is not removable. Making the purchase of a new battery to fix said problem impossible. I've always liked samsungs products..but this was a poor decision for their consumers.The screen. While the screen is beautiful and \"unboxed\"...it is 10x more fragile than any other Samsung or Galaxy I have owned. I cracked my screen within two weeks of ourchase. I was and still am, unable to find a tempered glass screen protector with a fully adhesive screen (because of the new design with the edge). I have sworn by tempered glass screen protectors in the past, they have saved me so many times. I was also unable to find one for the S7 as well. I did purchase one that only adhered on the edges, which did exactly what I thought it would.  It slid off the couch onto carpet and the screen popped right off the phone. Which for the record does nothing to absorb shock and prevent damage. I have the OtterBox symmetry case on my phone and it still cracked when dropped. Right on the stupid edge of the screen where it curves. Then a few months later, it slides off a shelf in the restroom and lands on tile flooring. Shatters again. I have shattered 3 out of the 4 corners on my screen all while in a case. I'd hate to see what happens when it's not in a case.Overall I am disappointed with this new screen, while it is beautiful and excellent for my photography hobby...it just isn't durable or practical. While the new technology advancements Android has made are excellent, I absolutely hate the quality of the phone. It's literally an $800 glass box around a computer."
"Amazon" "I am a long time Galaxy user.  My whole family and I have had Samsung Galaxies since the S3.  But this S8 annoys me to no end.  They are turning the Galaxy into an iPhone.  If I wanted form over function, silly proprietary annoyances just for the sake of an advertising image -- well, I would have bought an iPhone.  But I didn't.Battery:  I have had this S8 for 9 weeks now.  I cannot make it through the day without the phone dying.  That's bad enough.  But far, far worse is the fact that the battery cannot be changed. Lack of interchangeable batteries has long been the Achilles heel of iPhones.  iPhone users constantly complain about it.  So what does Samsung do?  Make a new model with a sealed, non-changeable battery.  So I guess we're supposed to just throw our $750 phone away once the battery goes bad. If all the other Galaxies has interchangeable batteries, and all us users loved it, why would you even consider removing that much-loved feature?  And don't tell me for waterproofing.  I don't care.  You should be able to figure that out.All-Glass Case:  Are you kidding me?  If you look at the phone wrong, it will break.  And it's unbelievably slippery.  Nice combination -- slippery, made of breakable glass, front and back.  People are breaking their phones between the time they get it at the T-Mobile store and the time Amazon Prime can deliver a protective case. And even with a case, it'll break. I mean come on, the whole thing is made of glass.  Of course it's going to break.Proprietary charging port:  The Galaxy S5 had a USB 3.0.  That was genius, seriously.  The S5 was universally compatible -- including backwards compatible with USB 2.0, which means practically every charging cable in the world could be used to charge it.  In addition, USB 3.0 is super fast for data transfers.  So, what does Samsung do?  Create a new, proprietary cable connection that doesn't exist anywhere else on any piece of technology ever invented.  What a great idea -- let's turn the best charging system into the worst.  And that's even worse than Apple.  iPhones are known for their unusable proprietary features, but at least there are lots of different iPhones that use their proprietary cable.  In this case, only the S8 uses this useless connection.Infinity Display:  Samsung touts the \"uninterrupted surface that flows seamlessly over the edges\".  Okay, one question.  Did anyone actually hold this phone in their hand before bringing it to market?  Because if they had, they would know that your hand cannot hold the phone without touching the \"seamless edges.\" Obviously.  So, various parts of your hand are constantly interfering with the function of the phone. So, just holding the phone, my hand is constantly fighting with my fingers for control of the phone.  I'd like to know -- who was asking for their phone to be turned into an infinity pool?  In case someone from Samsung is reading this, let me answer the rhetorical question: NO ONE.  No one cares that their phone wraps around the edge if it interferes with the operation of the phone.In other words -- form over function.  Give me a phone that works well over some gimmicky new change that no one cares about anyway.  Stop copying Apple, and bring back a real Samsung Galaxy."
"Amazon" "I was about to get the Samsung S8 Note if it was cheaper but I got this instead. Tons of features and just an overall satisfaction with the aesthetics"
"Amazon" "Love it. Way better than a iphone. And cheaper too"
"Amazon" "Perfect!"
"Amazon" "It's awesome"
"Amazon" "Are you on ios and wondering how difficult jumping ship to the android flagship phones would be?  Well, that is exactly what I did and here is my experience.I'm starting with my Conclusion because this is long: I love the hardware aspect of the Galaxy S8+ with very few exceptions. It's a beautiful phone. After a couple of weeks I have my phone useable with fairly similar apps and functions I used on iPhone. I like quite a bit of the additional functionality and customization offered. However, using the phone is like having every developer trying to turn the phone into a personal billboard trying to sell me something unless I'm willing to shell out $2 to $3 per app in most cases. To gain some of the higher end customization without ads can cost $5 or more in many cases.  It is quite a bit less efficient in every day use due to lack of streamlined integration between apps and additional ads.ABOUT MEI have pretty much used ios for all my smartphone and tablet needs for about 8 years (or whenever iPhone 3gs came out - I'm 99% sure it was before 2010).  I tested an android tablet for about 5 years ago and I was not impressed with the weight of the device nor the android apps so I stayed with ios.  I'm pretty sure after that experience is when I purchased my first iPad.  About a month ago I had a water incident with my iphone 6 plus and had to decide what phone to upgrade to.My motivation is because there are so many exciting phones in the near future, the Samsung reviews are extremely positive, and the Samsung S8+ is so much cheaper than the iphone 7+ after just months of being on the market (and I don't think this trend will change anytime soon). I jumped ship from ios so I could make a better decision about the next iPhone before its release (iPhone 8+ or whatever they name it).  I've used the Samsung Galaxy Plus phone exclusively for about 3 weeks. Here is what I struggled with, my suggestions for non-android users, what I've learned about android ecosystem, the pros and cons post switching, and what I will likely choose next.PHONE DESIGNBig Pro - This phone design makes people drool. It looks great and it feel great in the hand - especially when you compare the plus size versions.  I could have gone with the plain size of this phone and been absolutely happy. My eyesight isn't that great so the larger screen is great.Pro - The size of the phone is great in the hand.  The smaller one is even better. It feels better than iPhone Plus in the pocket, however the height is about the same so short pockets still cause issues.Pro - Build quality seems top of the line. Buttons work great, etc.Pro - I like the color options better than other phones out there.Meh - Expected to be a fingerprint magnet - and it is. LOLCon - The hard to reach finger scanner on back - I type the unlock code OFTEN due to placement.Con - Dedicated Bixby button - this button is just in the way; its placement causes accidental Bixby engagement all the time and Samsung has locked users out of reassigning the button.PERFORMANCE/BATTERYPro/Meh - In terms of speed the OS (Android Nougat I believe) on this device has come quite a long way. Overall I found the OS response almost on par with ios.  I understand the difference between open architecture and Apple's closed architecture, so this is a great achievement but it doesn't outperform ios in my use so I can't mark it as a clear Pro. It felt capable in every way. It didn't glitch in a way that I didn't find acceptable but ios still wins here.Pro - The ability to change performance modes is nice for increasing battery life or performance. I don't play any high performance games, but the gaming folder options to set the phone as a priority for gaming (no interruptions and high performance) may be the reason for some users to choose this over iPhone.Pro - Quick charging and wireless charging are nice to have available (although I dont have those set up in my house).Meh - With the customization of this phone, it is easy to affect battery life without realizing it. In real day to day useage, I don't have all my charging stations set up for this phones usb c connector - I have iPhone chargers set up in many rooms of my house out of necessity. With most of the usb chargers I have, I dont feel this phone charges much faster than my iPhone. In my experience so far the phone underestimates how long it will take to get to a full charge by quite a bit maybe 20 or 30 percent. The good part is that I don't think it will be any worse than using my iPhone - but I'm not charging this thing any less either.DURABILITYBig Pro - Waterproof. Since my last phone died due water and I was always putting my phone in a ziplock bag to run when weather was questionable or out at the lake, this is something I am glad to have.Meh - Screen glass is marketed to be pretty scratchproof. I've ordered a screen protector and I tried to keep the film on the glass while waiting for it to arrive, but the film didnt stay adhered but 4 days or so.  I've been careful and only carry the phone in my pocket by itself and I have a scratch. I've never scratched a phones screen this quickly but there are so many factors that I won't list it as a con.Meh - I cant speak to back durability personally since I was able to find protector quickly and have not dropped the phone. But videos online show that the back can crack if dropped on concrete from only 3 feet which is about waist height. Although other drop tests show it surviving drops from 5 feet, most crack the backglass at this height. Drop tests online seem to indicate decent front durability often surviving a 5 foot drop. From what I've researched, the front seems as durable as (if not a bit more than) an iPhone and the back really dictates a cover.SCREENPro - The screen resolution is great. I do like the screen, but in use at mid arms length away I can't tell much difference with the resolution at max or the mid setting. I appreciate the ability to run mine at the mid setting to save battery life.Big Pro - I stream movies on my phone often and getting a larger video with a more narrow phone is a GREAT experience.Pro - The curved glass is just sexy on electronics. The screens edge does a great job of ignoring touches when holding the phone. That edge is visible when the phone is face down so it can be set for notifications and I've seen the ability to run a stock ticker down it.Pro - Always on display with very little battery impact. I didn't realize how often I turn on my phone just to see the time or even date. Once this is set to disply the things you are 'just checking,' you will save some battery life.Con - The screen seems VERY dim in comparison to iPhone. It is capable of a comfortable brightness, but when maxed out I feel like I'm using a reduced setting from my iPhone.CAMERAPro - That damn camera bump is gone!!! This phone will sit flat on the table - nuff said if you are using an iPhone.Pro - The cameras (hardware) on this phone are best in class.  I give this phone the edge because in low light, it captures more light than any Apple phone.  In bright light, it's a draw unless you truly have need of the 2 cameras on the iphone.  In my use, my cropped images come out great so a 2nd lens doesn't add the same value as low light performance.  My video needs are the same - I need more low light performance than ability to use a different lens.MEH - I'm not labeling this a con on purpose.  I know there is a phone out there with 2 backfacing lenses. 2 lenses do not make me want that bump on the back of my phone.STORAGEPro - You get a respectable 64 Gig onboard and can add a card (whenever you need it) to increase it at a reasonable price using standard 3rd party memory cards.  None of that bulls**t Apple gouging.PORTS/BLUETOOTHPro - Its accessories are all generic. It is so nice to buy an extra cable for $2. I know I can buy 3rd party apple cables but some fit well and some are so tight you may damage the phone. I LOVE not having to deal with that - although switching all my phone docks and cables did cost a few bucks. If the next iPhone switches its port, I wouldn't be able to use them anyway.Pro - The earphone jack. I am no audiophile and have gone wireless for audio in most ways. But by design, my car connects phones to the radio with an audio cable. This phone requires nothing new to use that. Its an added plus when I forget to charge my wireless headphones.Con - The usb c connection just doesn't feel as tight to me.  When I connect the cable it doesnt align straight as easily as the lightning connector - even with using the cables provided with phone. Also, I get errors from different chargers that the phone is not connected completely. I think the error is because the phone is expecting a fast charger, but it has me a little concerned about reliability in the back of my mind.AUTHENTICATION/SECURITYPro - Eyescanner is great for unlocking phone. I've had better restults than many reviews. Mine will usually scan me correctly from a reading position if I pull the phone up toward my face about 2 feet. Even in dim light it usually reads which greatly reduces this next con.Con - I am sooo used to the fingerscanner, it is an unatural action to unlock ANYTHING on this phone. The placement is not where I can reach it naturally so I have to shift the phone to scan and it has gotten to be a real pain in the ass when I unlock apps.Con - Eyescanner either does not work to unlock apps (like paypal, etc) or it isn't coded in a way to easily connect it. It seem to only unlock phone.Con - Did I mention logging into apps is a pain in the ass on this phone? Dashlane is an app that makes this a bit more bearable but once you know how easy it is on Apple it is hardly comparable replacment. If you use financial apps, you will dedicate some time to trying to get around this. I think on the standard phone the fingerprint scanner felt more accessible so this may be an issue specific to the plus model.Meh - Facescanner is available but a photo can unlock the phone. As easily hacked as this is, I don't see the point of using this. Maybe if I wanted to lock a younger child out of my phone. Anyone over the age of 8 that wants to get into your phone will get past this lock.Meh - I generally don't feel as secure with my data in the apps, OS, and features of this phone and the android infrastructure. Many find this a pro since you can choose all these different apps to help. It is the same feeling when I use my windows computer, security is all on my shoulders and I better address it someway. And all the free solutions have ads. Apple has a great track record with securing data, privacy, etc. Everything I read about setting up android points you to security features to enable. Am I protected? I've installed some suggested apps, but who the hell knows.CUSTOMIZATIONPro - Out of the box, this phone is one of the most highly customizable phones available to change your experience to how you want the phone to look and behave. You can add and remove features of the OS (like the app drawer which iphone users do not have), edit how app icon looks, rename or remove app names, etc. Some customizations are pretty sweet - like backgrounds can move with movement of the phone and the camera can be used to sync the background with whatever colors the camera is capturing.Pro - The keyboard can be reduced in size and offset to the side of your prominent hand so that the keys are easy to reach with one hand. If the Big Con for word prediction didnt exist, this might be a reason to change phones when using plus size.Meh - Speech of OS. It is good but Apple does relistic speech better.Con (if new to android) - It is overwhelming to use this phone out of the box without some grounding first. It may be licensing or userbase expectation, but there are dual applications for many functions. It is preinstalled with Samsungs version of chat, email, and browser apps as well as the Android standard equivilent. As you set these up and start using them, they'll be prompting back and forth to change defaults. Some are similarly named and the functions between each have nothing dictating where the app settings will be located, how to engage the settings, etc. The OS does not have any wizard guiding you through steps in an order that makes sense. Apple sort of walks you through step by step of creating your Apple account first, then security choices, etc. You get none of that here. You keep tinkering with creating accounts and settings until something works, then you move onto the next thing you want to work. It may take a week to get this phone to replace an iPhone completely if you use many apps at all.Big Con - Using the keyboard drives me close to insanity because of how often the wrong word appears. It is functional (I've defaulted to using Gboard after some comparing of 3rd party) but it takes about twice the effort as iPhone. If I hadn't used iPhone I likely wouldn't notice but I have used one and I notice this fault - every time I have to type an email or text message.Con - I have some loss in trust in settings to take and work as expected. I've had this phone ring at work when I thought I had do not disturb set. I do not know why the setting changed and it was easy enough to address, but you must click and look for check marks, okays, enable, save buttons that iPhone never requires you to click.  There is no standard across the platform so unless you exit and go back into a setting, I never know it took.Big Con (for my use) - Enabling handicap features can be painful. On iPhone, I can set my phone up to triple tap to enable text to speech so the OS will read aloud to me. I use this very often to have kindle books read to me without having to rely on audible or paying for whispersync books. Enabling this on android is very difficult and it will not continue to read past a paragraph max. If someone has figured this out, please respond with comment.Big Big Big Con - Ads, ads, everywhere. Do you like having your phone boot into a screen with a big ad displayed in the middle of it? Well android provides that functionality - in fact every developer over uses it in a way iPhone users do not experience. Once you customize and get some crazy ad resulting, you'll need an app to find what is causing it. In fact, I almost returned this phone on day 2 because of an ad. And I got some good advice I'm passing along to you if you keep reading.FUNCTIONSPro - Best 3d experience available on a phone. For under $10 you can get a 3d headset for your phone and be immersed in some pretty awsome videos. Yes, iPhone does this too, but Samsung does it better. What I did not know is that the experience is 360 degrees. You'll need to stand up to turn around and see what is behind you, but when you are flying in that jet, you can see the pilot if you turn around. I watched a cartoon with aliens in front of me and rabbit hiding behind me and I missed half of the action because I kept trying to check what the rabbit was doing. This is not something I need to have in anyway, but it is fun and costs very little to get set up. Be forewarned, you will be seasick after your first use and riding a rollercoaster standing up in 3d can make you fall down.Pro - Audio over wireless just sounds better to me compared to iPhone 6. I don't know about other versions but with same headsets I get more bass, etc.Meh - Phone calls are okay but I'm not impressed with the app. It is harder to use and integration between apps is not all that great. Here are some of the items harder than iPhone - answering a call, finding and calling a contact, setting up a 3way call, adding a new call into a current call (still haven't gotten it to happen), selecting a phone number in another app and having phone app open and call.Meh - Bixby is Samsungs response to Siri (and Google Assistant which is on this phone also).  In concept Bixby should develop into something more useful than Siri for chaining commands together (set this setting and opne this app, or open this app and do this), but it is not fully realized yet. Having to hold the button for the duration of the command comes difficult to me and it feels unnecessary and I just don't like it. And I don't like that button anyway. Engaging google assistant is the same as Siri and I like that way of turning it on better. I've used Siri more so I know what to expect and I know what it does. I have less favorable results with both of these but Bixby was only recently enabled. I think it may develop into something pretty nice to use if Samsung will rethink that button and the requirement to hold it for the duration of the command. And honestly about half the time I've clicked on the Bixby button, I was trying to hold my phone or adjust my volume - bad placment.Con - One better like clicking okay and yes to use these apps. Android suffers from the same thing Windows does. You have to click an extra time or 2 to get a function to set. Even when logging in right now, I may have to push the home button, then swipe up, enter a code, and then click an ok to proceed. On my iphone, I pushed the home button and let my finger rest there and I was in. The majority of system settings and apps have similar unneccessary extra selections and swipes.Con - Speech to text in voice assistants, text message or email is truly unpredictable. I did not truly appreciate how well Apple does this until I stopped using it on this phone. It is really that bad in most real life situations that I want to use it.Big Con - There is an emergency call button (it will dial 911 if you click it) that is badly placed on the unlock screen. I conciously have to avoid hitting that stupid thing 20 to 40 times a day. It's these things that seriously puts iPhone ahead of Samsung in actual usage.  I don't have issue with it there, but I need option to move it up on screen where I won't accidentally hit it. I CANNOT BE THE ONLY PERSON THAT HATES THIS.Big Con - Audio volume is ok for music apps but it has an annoying warning about excessive volumes damaging hearing that I want to disable forever and it won't let me. I wouldn't mind seeing the warning and have it go away in a couple of seconds, but you must interact with the warning manually. It is especially irritating because of this next big con.Con - Audio in apps are extremely low when using cabled headsets and at least some on wireless. One example is podcast apps. I have to max out the phone volume and increase my car stereo volume to hear them at the same volume of songs. I use a jabra headset when driving in my car - it's what I used to use with my iPhone and the same issue is present with it. I don't know how many apps are affected, and it may be setting related, but it is an issue out of the box.Con - Videos do not go full screen by flipping screen sideways. In almost every instance iPhone does this by default. It is not the case here - ofen it takes a click or 2 to get that to take.APPSPro - Multiple app stores to download products.Pro - Because android allows more access to hardware and OS, there are apps for a whole different use than what Apple apps provide. There are many apps to add functionality to the phone. The phone can go into silent mode or reduce its volume anytime you arrive at work for example. You can change your icons from developer default to marbles with the app name listed on them.Meh - Apps are mostly as functional as what IOS equivilent provides, but they aren't streamlined for ease of use. I miss my iPhone apps quite a bit.Con - Most underground app stores likely have viruses in part of their offered apps.Con - Most free apps have ads.Big Con - Unless you are willing to download apps from 'risky' locations, apps without ads are double or triple the price on Apple. I rarely see any paid for app include an ad but I see many paid for apps include apps after purchase.UNTESTEDNA - Provided headphones. They are marketed to be $100 street value but I use wireless audio and haven't had the need to test yet.And here are my suggestions for those not used to Android:Don't do as I did. As soon as I got basics down (before I sorted out what I needed to work), I hit the store and got lost in downloading free apps. Before I knew it I had a bunch of apps I didn't remember the function for and I included a launcher that sounded soooo great.  And then I figured out what came with those downloads - apps. I was UNHAPPY for a day with an app on my home screen. It was from the launcher by the way. The launcher made me about half crazy trying to work against it. So, if you are stuck in this mode, uninstall, uninstall, uninstall. Airpush Detector is an app that can help identify sources of ads.Stay with Samsung's default touchwiz launcher at first.  A launcher gives you a look and feel to the device and determines what functions you can add and remove from the settings.  When new to android, touchwiz gives plenty to play with and see what is available and you don't get embedded ads up front.Put the settings app somewhere you can find it easily.By default, the touchwiz launcher gives you a main landing screen that has a google search field and the primary row of phone related apps you see on every screen and one seconadary row of icons that belongs to this landing screen only. When you scroll to the right, the primary row will go with the view and the secondary will go offscreen with the rest of that landing screen. The idea is that the apps on the secondary row are your most frequently used apps along with the main phone apps on the primary row. When you scroll to the screen to the right, that screen is similar to what iPhone screens look like - a grid for placing apps over a chosen background. Each time you scroll to the right you can add one of these grid screens as iPhone does. Something not found on iPhone is an app drawer. It is available from each screen, if you swipe upward on the primary row - there is an up arrow on the primary row indicating the app drawer and you can choose to keep or remove a dedicated button that opens it as well. That drawer has a default copy of every app installed on the phone. If you want one on any of the main screens, press and hold an app inside the app drawer and it will let you pull it upward out of the drawer and it will drop to whatever location you release it at. The copy will remain in the drawer unless you explicitely delete or hide it from there.If you already know you don't like the app drawer concept, you can remove it and the upward screen swipe function will go away and all installed apps will drop onto the those grid screens - just like how iPhone behaves. If you are getting lost looking for apps, go ahead and remove the app drawer now to get closer to the iPhone default setup: Settings app icon > Display > Home screen > Home screen layout.  I suggest adding it back at a later date to see if you like it later; once there isn't so much to get used to at once.You likely are used to having a set of apps on the main row of your homescreen from whatever smart phone you come from. Change the row of apps on the primary row to match what you currently use and set those apps up for use.The timeout to black out the screen is way too fast when one is trying to figure out how to configure the phone. Go to settings and change setting not to lock if looking at screen.  Bixby can help find - just hold the button and ask to change that setting. If you have no Samsung account, you get to set up your account now.The phone is likely completely unlocked to anyone - you should set up security at some point - I suggest setting the passcode, the fingerprint scanner & the iris scanner. You'll be unlocking the phone once you do this, so decide if you want to do this now or later.The phone comes with 2 app stores installed, they are Samsung Market and Google Playstore.  I do not group my apps by developer. I group them by what they do. I suggest you pull the apps out of any folders they are in and put the near each other.  I usually look in the Samsung Marker first to see if there is a version of an app developed specifically for this phone and if not, I look in Google Playstore which will be developed for android phones in general.Next get some sort of security on the phone. Most carriers will have some sort of security app pre-installed. Launch it and make sure it is set up. I also installed Avast from one of the app store due to its popularity across android forums.If you are like me, you now have lots of apps running in the background. Press the dedicated recent softkey next to the home button. It is indicated by 2 arrows making a box. You can close them all.Initially, I was getting confused by apps provided to do same thing. Select an app for each function and remove the other app.Messaging clients: I hid Messages (it wont uninstall) & stayed with message+ until I could navigate the OS easily.Browsers: This is a difficult choice. Samsung Internet(purple globe) is designed to be integrated with this phones hardware and shows to be most similar to iPhone's browser for efficiency.  In my usage, it blocked sites that Chrome didn't and that I didn't feel were unsafe.  If you have no preference and gmail isn't your default form of communicating, I'd disable Chrome (no uninstall available) unless you have same issue I had. If you are tied to gmail, I'd use Chrome and hide/uninstall Internet if it'll let you.If you were using an iPhone before, Samsung has provided an app called Smart Switch to hook to your iPhone with provided hardware in the box (the one with the usb hookup adapter) and it will scan your iPhone and set up your contacts, move your photos if you have room, and find matching apps from the stores.  I'd run that at this time.Now go find a free background or theme you like in one of the stores.Select what displays on your always on display.Set up your apps and you should be set to use the phone for a bit.Once you are comfortable using all that you have set up - maybe a day or 2, set up the edge app. You'll have a better idea by that time what might be nice to have on that shortcut.Other Suggestions:Set do not disturb on a schedule (in the settings app) if you get woken up by text messages and such at night.Block blue light with sunset (in the settings app) - supposedly reduces affects of phone screen on your sleep.Set finger scanner to swipe down to pull notifications open - honestly I dont use it, but go ahead - it's kind of cool.Note:You cannot delete apps that are sitting on the primary apps bar - you must relocate it to the grid. Depending on app, it may not allow uninstall, but you may be able to disable and/or hide.  Worst case, make a folder and hide all unused apps in it.After a few days, research what a widget is and set one up on one of your screens - Maybe a calendar or a clock.After a few more days, research what \"edge\" apps are available to you.Some apps that I'm using:Ad source finder- air push detector (suggested by coworker)Downloaded & changed keyboard to GBoard (suggested by forums and tested well against others I tried)Ad blocker - Crystal Ad blocker (can't remember why I chose this)Pw manager - Dashlane shows up top in many reviews (you have to engage the app to set up the pw)Browser - Puffin pro (free has ads) for speed of use - but it has a drawback of memory consumption compared to other browsersChat client - Textra (mainly testing from high reviews)Widget - I'm using a widget called Month to put a calendar on one of my grid screens."
"Amazon" "This phone was rated as \"good\" from warehouse deals. When it arrived it was in the factory box and looked like it had never been opened.  The plastic was still on the screen. I found no scratches or imperfections. My carrier is Sprint. It is truly unlocked for all carriers.They had me hooked up in about 15 minutes. The clerk asked me if i had bought the phone new from Samsung directly. He told me it was the unlocked version that would work internationally too.I have had the phone a couple of weeks and it has performed flawlessly. This was another great buy for me here on Amazon. If you are on the fence like I was about upgrading to the S8, go ahead and buy one here, its just an awesome phone. I had an S5 that was great but this S8 is so much better. Trust me on this. Go ahead and buy it. You will be amazed too!"
"Amazon" "I upgraded to this S8 from my S6 Edge since I was getting fed up with the capped storage capacity at 64GB otherwise I probably would have waited another year or 2. (And sun spots which burned permanent purple dots on my front facing cam. . .)This phone has some upgrades which I personally enjoy:-Battery Capacity. Holy cow. This thing actually lasts me over 10 hours of almost constant Netflix streaming with brightness at 75% with bluetooth wireless earbuds and that only bring its to about 30-35% battery. It then still lasts the rest of the day at 25% brightness taking it down to just about 15% battery. (I normally start charging it up once it hits 20% though)-Camera Function: Incredibly fast focus and quality. (Only minor con is that it's not amazing in low light, using ProMode helps a bit though)-Smooth touchscreen with a lot of customization features within the phone itself.-Being an unlocked phone, minimal bloatware comes on the phone. (Sadly there are some things...)-You can easily turn Bixby off if you don't like it. (The camera item search/translator is pretty fun though!)-Always on display is actually really helpful for me since I don't have to reach over to see the time if I randomly wake up in the middle of the night. I keep it simple without a background and just colorized text, so it doesn't seem to consume much battery even if it's. . . always on. (You can also set it up to show during certain hours in a day.)-It still allows your to insert microphone jacks.-USB-C, I personally like it since I dont have to worry about turning it around to fit anymore. (Box also comes with some adapters.)-And obviously the MiscroSD storage. Stuck a 128GB card in there upon arrival.Some downsides on the phone:-Fully made of glass. It's not cheap feeling in the slightest, but it makes you a bit more paranoid if it does fall. (Highly recommend a good case for this phone)-Wish this came with a non-Edge version. Honestly don't enjoy it that much and causes issues with a lot of screen protectors, but I couldn't pass up the sale on the phone.-Comes pre-installed with Facebook. I don't use facebook so it's just an annoying app chilling on my phone which I'd rather have completely uninstalled instead of just disabled.-Bixby button. . . well that thing is just kinda there. I don't hit it often but when I do it's just mildly inconvenient. Thankfully my case has little ridges on the button which make it easier to locate the volume when needed. The button can become an issue on some phone stands though.This phone was able to hit all the things that I want in a phone: Good camera, long battery life, adjustable storage, crisp display, and functional.All in all, I very much enjoy this phone with only minor gripes which aren't enough to make me dislike the phone at all.(Yes, this phone works with most if not all carriers. That includes Verizon. You can even see this written on Samsung's fine print for the phone. You may need to have the SIM card activated in another phone first then switch it into your S8.)"
"Amazon" "The Galaxy S8 is a solid, quality phone based on my use of it over the past month+.  It was a welcome upgrade to my S5, which had become terribly buggy and crash-prone with the latest software updates.  I hesitated to give Samsung another try after so many later problems with the S5.In the end it was worth the upgrade.  As expected, the S8 was fast and slick, although some of the standard apps suffer from usability changes for the worse, compared to the S5.  I have come to expect this with any major software/hardware upgrade so it's hardly worth mentioning.Of note however, is the hoops I had to jump through to get this phone working with Verizon.  This review has less to do with any issues with the phone itself (there have been almost none) and more to do with the general incompetence of the specific staff at my local Verizon store.This unlocked 64GB phone is perfectly compatible with the Verizon network and now is working great; however, the Verizon store employees were unable to get my phone working out of the box because it was not a \"Verizon Branded\" S8.  Do yourself a favor; call Verizon tech support to get it figured out.  After almost a full day of fruitlessly working with the store employees and managers and being sent on one wild goose chase after another, a 15 minute call to Verizon tech support resolved everything.Note that this phone takes a mini SIM card and can't simply be swapped from the S5; this is why I had to endure a trip to the local Verizon store at all.Also note; if activating this unlocked phone on Verizon, they will not allow you to download or install their standard Verizon voicemail app.  You will be required to download another voicemail app/service from the Google app store.  Not a big deal; Youmail fits the bill just fine for me.Other than those few minor bumps, it was much worth getting the unlocked S8 on Amazon for hundreds less, without being stuffed to the gills with bloatware, compared to the Verizon branded S8."
"Amazon" "hello i bought the Samsung galaxy but when the phone detects moisture it doesn’t charge the battery. How can I fix it?"
"Amazon" "The good: I'm really glad that I got this over spending more for a Verizon phone. There's less garbage on it from the carrier (and the few things that it tried to install when I inserted the SIM card were able to be uninstalled). The battery life is pretty crazy. Even without the power saver mode turned on, it lasts all day. Switch on power saver mode and it won't use hardly any power unless the screen is turned on. The curved screen doesn't cause issues with the touch screen while using it one-handed, and is positively gorgeous. People actually ask me what phone I have. The camera is super fast and takes amazing pictures.The bad: Bixby is not what it's cracked up to be in my opinion. Sure it can do some cool stuff, but 90% of the time it's not helpful. Additionally, there's a really quick, perceptible wait for the microphone to turn on when you hold the button down. I also tend to push the button (or it gets pushed as it's going into my pocket) on accident. For some reason when I type the microphone key on the keyboard to do voice dictation, it refuses to use the Google voice recognition engine. It's not really slick so it won't fall out of your hand, but when I put it screen down on my nightstand, there's some coating or something on the screen that will actually let the phone slowly slide around (because the table isn't 100% level)."
"Amazon" "Im not going to get into huge detail here, but I love this phone.The Camera is amazingThe screen is amazingThe fingerprint scanner works better than everyone says it does.I have taken this phone in the shower with me multiple times. 0 problems.it played music underwater (not recommended) with 0 problems.It does take a little getting used to, but the longer I have it, the more I love it.Honestly I can't think of one thing I don't like.except that I wish the bixby button was programmable.And I would recommend the otterbox Defender series case. Ive had it for weeks and it has been incredible."
"Amazon" "First let me get this out of the way: This phone for the most part is awesome. The specs are beastly, the camera is among the best in class, the 1440p bezel-less curved display looks amazing, and the features this phone has is vast and actually useful in everyday usage. But while this phone is objectively one of the best out right now, it is also one of the most fragile. The backglass on mine broke within a week of usage and I actually had to replace the backglass in order to fix this. To put it in context, the only other phone glass that I have ever broke is the iPod Touch 4th gen, and I had that for nearly 2 years of usage before that happened. This is not a durable phone in the slightest, and I would highly recommend getting a case or skin for it if you plan to get this phone. Outside of that, this is a great phone and I'd recommend it assuming you are cautious enough to avoid issues"
"Amazon" "the phone in itself is fine. i bought this with a trade in phone so supposedly i was getting $125 for the old phone. well, a month later, samsung sales came back to say sorry, your item does not qualify for trade in so we charging you 125 dollars extra. i asked to return the s8 here as clearly this was now beyond my budget. well, you wish. they said i had only 15 days after the purchase day to return it so i am stuck now with an over priced item. i am still reporting Samsung to the Federal Trade Commission to try to resolve this issue (after all, how was i supposed to return within 15 days when they rejected the item a month later, clearly the 15 days should apply to the moment the buyer has all the final costs charged). anyways beware of the dirty tricks that samsung plays with the customer. if you come to rely on their support, you may as well be on your own."
"Amazon" "Been an iPhone user since the 4, up until this baby came into my life. Initially I was scared to take the leap but I'm glad I did. The s8 is the most beautiful phone I've come across and I'm so happy that it's mine. It does everything I need and more. If you're thinking about switching to Android, this is the sign for you to take that leap.Fast shipping & perfect condition! All I had to do to activate mine (w Verizon) was transfer my sim card from my 6+ to the s8 and voila! I'm a very happy girl with my new s8 :)"
"Amazon" "overall after having this device for a little while it is a decent device clean video playback and great camera however the few minor issues keeping this from being a higher review the back glass is very brittle the screen is decent as for durability and great for playback my review would be a 4 star except for the fact that once i downloaded the update that was ready to be installed out of the box (i waited a month before installing so i could see what all was impacted by it) i have noticed a slight decline in battery life and complete loss of the microphone in calls unless i have speakerphone on or an external headset i will update this post if and when a new update comes around to fix that problem.finally would i recommend this phone? yes i would as long as you keep a headset as part of your daily routine or chose to not install the updates.Updated rating up to 4 stars as the December update has fixed all problems with the microphone and no longer requireing a head set to use as a phone"
"Amazon" "Pros: The phone is fast.Good battery life.Very nice looking phone.Display looks very nice.Cons:  My hand would often unintentionally touch a part of the wrap around screen and close browser windows, apps, etc.  This happened often enough to be fairly annoying.Several apps were buggy and would close by themselves or would just not work at all (such as cycletrader app).  There were some annoying quirks with the youtube app.The fingerprint reader is the worst I've used yet, it always took at least 3 or 4 tries every time I got my phone out.  Super annoying.Facial recognition on this phone is a joke.I don't like Samsung's overlay on Android Nougat.  The Samsung keyboard sucks. Stock Android is so much nicer IMO.Overall, for a flagship phone and even at a deeply discounted price I wasn't too impressed with this one.  I have a feeling I would be much happier with a Pixel or the upcoming Pixel 2."
"Amazon" "So, the makers of this phone decided to add a personal assistant that pops up whenever you click a button on the side. I have everything integrated with Google and have no need for another personal assistant nor any desire to test one out. But, I constantly accidentally hit this button, and this thing that I have no desire/need for constantly pops up, usually right when you're in the middle of something.\"But why don't you just disable it?\" you might say. Well, they make you sign up for an account and go through a whole process just to get to the screen where you can disable the button. So, after a month of aggravation, I finally decided to go through the hassle of disabling this stupid thing that I have not desire nor need for. Well, ok, I finally get it disabled, but having to give it my personal information and such, and who know what kind of data it's gathering. Not to mention power it uses, data it uses, and taking up a whole screen constantly to the left of the main screen. So, I decide to disable the app entire. Well, there's like 4 apps it uses, and you have to disable all of them. But, surprise, Samsung deliberately makes it impossible to disable.So, this all seems like a grand ploy to force you to use their personal assistant, and they figure that you've already bought the phone and won't go through the hassle of returning it, accustoming yourself with another phone, etc.. But take it from me, save yourself. Get a different phone now."
"Amazon" "I'm going to start out this review by stating that I have basically hated the Galaxy S phones since they've come out.  I loved my old Samsung flip phone, but when they made the move to Android, I just couldn't get into them.  I read how amazing the Super AMOLED screen was, and I thought it was garbage.  It was grainy and the colors were much too garish and off.  The UI was cartoony and had weird colors.  Over the years, though, Samsung slowly stripped away the bloat, refined their screens, cleaned up their Android skin, and after all this time I can finally say that they've sold me.The feel:The first thing I noticed with this phone was how amazing it feels.  It's crazy thin, and encased in cool, smooth curved glass.  It has just the right amount of heft to make it feel premium.  It feels like a smooth, elegant and flat pebble.  With the infinity screen it (and its brothers the S8+ and Note 8) is easily the most attractive phone I've ever seen, a departure from the older Galaxy S phones which had never struck an aesthetic note with me.While the elongated shape of the phone seems odd at first, and actually makes the screen more narrow than other flagships, it works well for accessing the entire screen with one hand.  While it's still a stretch, it's more managable that way and makes the new on-screen navigation keys less obtrusive.  Speaking of the on-screen keys, I've never been a fan until now.  They work well and the home \"button\" even has a vibrating \"click\" when you press it in, which I like for turning on your screen and unlocking it in one shot.The physical buttons are a bit too easy to accidentally press, which I don't like, and the Bixby button (which I'll get to later) is unnecessary and makes the volume keys harder to find.As much as I like the design, this phone NEEDS a case.  I don't mean that as a bad thing, although for some people I'm sure it will be.  It's delicate.  The all-glass design makes it highly vulnerable to breaking, as you'll find reading reviews and watching drop tests.  The edge display detects accidental touches on occasion.  The volume keys are too clicky.  The phone is thin and smooth which makes it too easy to drop.  A case solves all of these problems.  Even if I didn't work in construction (which I do), I would put a case on this phone.  I personally went with the Spigen Rugged Armor Samsung Galaxy S8 Case, Spigen® [Rugged Armor] Galaxy S8 Case Cover with Resilient Shock Absorption and Carbon Fiber Design for Galaxy S8 (2017) - Black- 565CS21609 case, which I highly recommend.  There's even a Youtube video where a guy drops it on tile floor and it just bounces, with no damage whatsoever.Software:For years Samsung's TouchWiz was bloated and ugly.  I hated the cartoony look and the garish colors (which were made worse by the extreme oversaturation of the Super AMOLED screen).  But now, with the paring down of bloat, it's finally become useable.  A while back Samsung also introduced a theme engine into their phones and I'm glad they did.  I was able to change all of the default Samsung apps and menus into the black shades that I love so much.  You can even replace the icons with a different themes, although I ended up using Nova Launcher with some icons I had bought for it.I like the way Samsung has set up their apps.  They are clean, usable, intuitive, but still full of handy features.  Probably my least favorite is the Gallery, although my complaints are minor.  My issue is that the pictures are all clumped into a giant, solid wall of pictures, which makes it difficult to differentiate between each file.  The little overlays that tell you if it's a video or a photo, etc. are in plain white text that sometimes is hard to read against lighter pictures.  But the email app, dialer, calendar, system menus, etc. are all a pleasure to use.  Everything runs fast and I even found myself using the split screen feature for the first time ever (I had to do some calculator work and type numbers into a spreadsheet) which impressed me.There is still bloat though.  Samsung has a bunch of redundant features that mirror those of Google's, which aggravates me.  It would be fine if I planned on sticking to the Samsung phone ecosystem for the rest of my life, but I'm not even close to making that commitment.  I still use all of Google's services, because I can use them on any Android phone.  You get Samsung Calendars, Samsung Health, Samsung Pay (which I'll elaborate more on), Samsung backup, and others.  It's mostly not a chore to use Google's features instead, but you really need to pay attention on things like the calendars and contacts to make sure you're using their Google equivilants.To be honest I didn't even try Bixby.  Google Assistant is more than I need, and I don't like having an extra home screen or a button specifically for Samsung's digital assistant.  Fortunately you can completely disable both the button and the service, but you have to fully enable it and set it up before you can do that.  The button is not capable of being set for anything else, so if you disable Bixby you basically end up with a useless button on the side of your phone.The Galaxy S8 has the infinity edge screen so that means it comes with the Edge shortcuts.  This is a menu you can slide out from the side of your screen and run apps, call contacts, etc. with.  There are actually a ton of extra features and screens you can download for it, but in the end I didn't see the need for one more thing on my screen.  That being said, I think that if a person set it up and used it regularly, it may become a handy feature.Samsung Pay is a feature I was surprised by.  My phone came with a promotional $50 credit via Samsung Pay so I was obligated to use it.  The first time I tried it, it was just like in the commercial: the cashier assured me that they couldn't do it, and she clumsily fumbled with the card scanner trying to figure out just how it was going to happen.  I calmly reached over and waved my phone over the reader, and like magic, it accepted payment.  I got a receipt on my phone and happily went on my way.  I've used it three times total, and the first two times it worked, but the third it failed even though the reader specifically said it worked with Samsung Pay.  As cool as the first two times were, I didn't appreciate looking like a fool while I waved my phone around a card reader like an idiot.Hardware:Another feature I was surprised by was the fingerprint reader.  I found myself using it in my money apps, which makes them much simpler.  It's very quick and let me log into my Wells Fargo and Paypal apps instantly, which is convenient for checking balances, sending payments, etc.  Yes, the reader has a terrible location next to the camera.  However, this is another feature that is fixed by putting a case on your phone.  Once you have a cutout for the camera, your finger can easily find the edge of the hole where the reader lies, making it essentially a non-issue.Battery life so far has been great.  This is the seventh Android phone I've owned, and I don't recall any of them getting phenomenal battery life.  My galaxy S5 I briefly owned (used, to replace an LG G3 with a cracked screen) got terrible life but that could have been other factors.  This one gets me through a full work day with moderate social media use, and in today's world that's the most I hope for from a cell phone.  I do have to put it on the charger in the evening, but only briefly and then it gets me through bedtime.  The battery is not removable however so keep that in mind.I've never tried wireless charging before, but I did with this phone simply because the chargers are cheap and easily available, and I had to buy new cables anyway for the new USB C standard, so I snagged a wireless charger from Amazon.  I didn't use the Samsung charger or cable so I'm sure it could have been faster, but in about 4 hours it filled up the battery from almost dead.  This works well for me for charging overnight, but you can't use your phone while it's lying on the pad so it might not be great for other uses.Call quality has been wonderful.  The volume of the ear speaker is actually more than I need, which is a good thing.  I'd rather turn the audio volume down on a call then top it out and wish it would go louder.  The external speaker is adequate, not being overly quiet but not really sounding impressive in any way.  I didn't get any complaints on speakerphone mode.The screen almost needs its own catagory.  As I stated, for years I've hated Super AMOLED.  I don't get how people thought the early screens looked good.  The saturation was so high, and the colors were off, so that when the brightness was up (and these displays are bright) it made my eyes bleed.  But finally, with this phone, I feel that the colors and saturation are perfect.  The screen is super bright too, and in fact Samsung's auto-brightening technology learns what setting you use at different light levels, making this the first Android phone I've ever had auto-brightness turned on with.  The resolution is actually turned down when you buy the phone, which I recommend not messing with.  You can turn it up to 4k, but it's not needed and the battery will be drained more quickly.  As it is, pictures and text are extremely clear.  Everything just looks so great on this screen, I find myself staring at it sometimes just to admire it.  The infinity edge feels good too, giving it a nice rolled over feel when you swipe towards the sides.  The phone has a feature called always on display, which leaves the clock, battery percentage, and little notification icons on your screen even when it's locked.  The brightness is turned down so that you don't get screen burn-in, and I found that I liked this feature, which didn't seem to affect battery drain.The camera is one of the reasons I bought this phone.  I've heard for a few years now that Apple and Samsung cameras are always neck and neck in quality.  In practice, I'm mostly happy with my choice.  In well lit conditions pictures come out wonderful.  Colors are great and they've very clear.  Burst shots are amazing, shooting literally 60 pictures in about a second.  Low light shots were a mixed bag, though.  The lighting in the pictures is definitely brighter than in real life, which is great, but for whatever reason once you hit a certain threshold the colors become washed out and any movement at all causes blurring.  This is a problem common to cameras and is related to aperture and shutter speed, but I honestly expected this phone camera to do better.  Perhaps it's a setting I need to enable, but as of right now I was a little disappointed.  However, if this phone camera is near the top of the heap, I suppose I don't have much choice but to accept it.Summary:I know this has been a long-winded review but a phone is a major purchase in a person's life and I feel like I needed to share my full experience to buyers.Overall I love this phone.  There are no major issues with it and using it is a joy.  I'm sure it's partly the new phone effect, but I find myself trying to come up with reasons to use it so I can enjoy the beautiful screen and snappy performance.  It has a few minor flaws here and there, and a bit of the obligatory Samsung bloat, but so far it's been a wonderful experience.  I would highly recommend it."
"Amazon" "Ordered this device while Harvey was ongoing. There was a slight delay, but that was inevitable due to the inclement weather. Arrived within the time frame and Amazon notified me, as and when there were delays.The device was grouped with the Case and Screen Protector that I had ordered, which was very convenient. Packaging was secure which is expected for this device at such a price range.Overall, the phone is brilliant. Sharp display, clear camera images with AF. It runs all apps like a breeze and is well suited for heavy multitasking. The bezel-less display is a joy to look at and reading on it is very comfortable. It also ships with USB (B to C) and (A to C) adapters, which helps during our transition to USB C type plugs.The battery life is amazing, for a phone with such a sharp and bright display, and also considering the hardware. The 3500mAh battery offers enough juice for an entire day of light usage. Heavy use - like watching movies or playing games like Real Racing, etc. drains it faster, but that is expected from demanding apps.The issue of the fingerprint sensor being too close to the camera is real for the first few days; but after using it as your daily driver, you tend to figure out where it is and it doesn't pose much of a bother, unless you deliberately want to smudge your camera lens.I would highly recommend this device to anyone with a moderately high budget. It looks amazing and performs much better than it looks. I would also recommend to get a protector case (the rear side is a fingerprint magnet and you wouldn't want to crack this amazing display) and a screen protector. To all those having second thoughts, I would say: Go for it!"
"Amazon" "UPDATE 12/22/17: My phone is still going strong and looks pretty much the same as when I first got it. I'm still using the same Speck Candyshell Grip case and same liquid install screen protector. They are in great shape and providing enough protection tor my phone. The glitchy stuff seems to have mostly been fixed after an update. I have the unlocked version. Facebook app has been sucking big time, so I mostly access facebook through a browser and only use the facebook app to post pictures.When picking a phone over the past few months, I tried iphone 6s(hated the locked down feel and it had major battery drain with my music app that could not be fixed, so that was a deal breaker), Huawei Mate 9(Has a good camera, good battery life when battery drain isn't happening, but it isn't optimized for google apps and gets battery drain every couple weeks so I had to reset it all the time, ridiculous), LG G6(Great front camera, loved the wide-angle option, terrible front camera circa 2013 and bad connectivity with my Honda UPlay and Google play music)....And, now the Samsung S8, I have had it for a month now. It takes pretty good pictures. The Mate 9 had more detailed pics, but S8 takes better low-light photos in my experience. I'd say they are about tied for front cameras. The selfie camera is slightly better with the Mate 9 than the S8 because you can adjust more on the Mate 9 and the focus seems to be a little better when people stay in the background of a photo and not side by side. I prefer the Mate 9 photo gallery, too. It's easier to select photos to share. The speakers are a bit quiet and not as nice sounding on the S8 verses the Mate 9. Mate 9 has loud speakers with stereo option when it's side, but the S8 sounds acceptable and is much improved over my old Samsung S3. It's quieter than the LG G6 as well and comparable to the iPhone 6s. I heard the newer iPhones have stereo speakers and get pretty loud, though. But, new model iPhones are too expensive for me and offer less features than android phones at a similar price.So far, the Samsung S8 is still the better phone, it's more reliable, it does not have battery drain and the battery life is consistently allowing 6-7 hrs screen on time if all used in one day or around 5 hrs if used over 2 days. I do have to restart my phone sometimes because of minor glitches here and there. Not often, just a couple times a week, so no biggie. It does have a buggy connection with Google Play Music and Honda Uplay, but it still plays the music, it just causes the menu to flash on and off, but it's ignorable and better than not working like the G6, Mate 9 didn't have this problem, but the battery drain still makes Mate 9 a loser for me. I prefer the smaller feel of the S8. It feels very comfortable to hold as compared to the phablet phones like Mate 9. Samsung S8 has many accessories available to it that Mate 9 did not offer in the US due to lack of popularity. S8 has a car charger option, battery pack charger option, and many cases and screen protector options. I tried a couple cases and found the Speck Candyshell Grip case to be the best, I like that it gives some protection around the edge part of the screen while still leaving you full functionality and it's not bulky. I dropped my phone a couple times in the case from a couple feet up and the phone is unharmed.I used an IQ shield liquid install screen protector and that works well even though it takes longer to install. No issues with it coming loose until now. I don't like the curved phone screen, but the Samsung S8 is one of the best phones available and beats out the competition in my opinion. I got mine for close to $600 with tax, I don't think I would pay more than that. Watch for sales. It's been on sale many times since it's release. I would not recommend buying from Samsung directly. I bought one S8 from Samsung and returned it before going back and buying it again elsewhere. The return through Samsung took a month and I had to contact them a second time before they finally processed the return with some message about getting lost at the facility or something, but they still have a note about receiving it. Amazon is a good place to buy from as long as you buy directly through Amazon and not through a third party. It's nice that they give you a 30 day return period. That's the longest period I have seen anywhere.If you want an Android phone, Samsung is still the best available in the states, in my opinion. There are more nice phones available overseas, but you want to have a US warranty, easily available accessories, etc, that leaves you with Samsung, LG, Google, and iPhone for the most part. One big negative with Samsung is that screen is SUPER expensive to replace. I would not get a Samsung S8 if you are rough on your phones. There is an S8 active available through ATT and it's supposed to release for other carriers and maybe unlocked in the future from what I read. Maybe Amazon will get it, too?"
"Amazon" "I have many Samsung products, and am happy with all of them, but I am not happy that this phone requires not just one, but two proprietary pieces in order to charge it properly, or one just to hook it up to another device. It does not have a Micro USB connection, it has an adapter that you need to use just to hook it up to a Micro USB cord. If you plug the USB end into any normal charger, or even a USB port on a computer, the phone takes FOREVER to charge (25% charge over 8 hours). You need to plug the cord into Samsung's \"adaptive fast charger\" in order for it to charge in a reasonable amount of time. The whole reason I buy Android instead of iPhone is because I don't want to have proprietary software, hardware or peripherals, I want to buy things that work across multiple devices. I have Micro USB cords everywhere, at home, in my car, at work, one stashed in my luggage in case I forget to pack one on vacation... now, they are all useless to charge this phone unless I happen to have not one, but both of the proprietary parts needed to charge the thing. Unless, of course, I pay them just to have extras so that I can conveniently charge my phone anywhere that I am. It really seems like Samsung is trying to separate themselves from all other Android products by having their own charging devices, and they even have their own Apps and a Browser. All of this I can avoid if I choose, except the charger part.I, like others, have most everything set up through Google, but Samsung wants to force you to use their Apps and software, like Bixby, their version of a personal assistant. And there is no way to replace Bixby, you can turn it off, but the home key is forever tied to this app. I don't want thing that only work with Samsung, I want things that work with Android.The phone does not have a way to double tap a notification to open it; you need to unlock the phone, then open your notification. I've researched this online, and others have the same complaint and no way to turn on that functionality."
"Amazon" "If Customer Service is important, STAY AWAY. The phone is great but if it needs service, don't count on Samsung to do what they promise. My phone arrived with a scratch in the Gorilla Glass. I talked to a Samsung rep who said they would for sure repair that and we arranged to have my phone sent in. They ask you to send in the charger and cable too, so I did. After a week, I received a $300 quote for the repair I was told would be no charge. By the end of the call, they agreed to fix the scratched glass. Another week went by and I received my phone completely unrepaired and missing my charger and cable. I called back and the rep I spoke to said the repair was approved but somehow it was never authorized so they just sent my phone back to me. After further discussion, they PROMISED to take care of the screen and asked me to send in my phone. I trusted their promise and sent in my phone. After two weeks, I received my phone back, again unrepaired. Another call to customer service later and they couldn't tell me whether they were simply inept or if they had just lied to me. The experience has left me sour for not only Samsung phones but for all other Samsung products as well. As far as I'm concerned, if it's a Samsung, it's not going into my house."
"Amazon" "Love it...it works on my verizon sim card as well as wth my sim card from the Philippines..the camera is so clear..thanks amazon for fast and safe shipping"
"Amazon" "Just after my support ended, my screen seems to have begun having a hardware issue. Horizontal lines have begun appearing, and it looks to be a hardware issue. Pretty disappointed that the Amazon support does not last longer considering I've seen multiple posts online about this being an issue. I haven't had any drops or water issues with the phone, so it looks like the AMOLED screens become defective after a certain time potentially.  Note that if you contact Samsung about this, they will require you to send your phone back, which can be a problem if you do not have another phone to use during that time. Buyer beware!"
"Amazon" "wow! the best galaxy S line to date.  exceptionally well fingerprint sensor and iris scan for security. however, the face scan i have not perfected. everything pretty much upgraded from the 7 line. does everything an android was built to do and more. if comparing with an iphone, i love that i don't need itunes to access my phones files, etc. just plug into any computer and go! google play has tons of useful apps for everyday use and i feel the device is limitless for my personal use."
"Amazon" "This phone is very fragile, I accidentally dropped it 1 ft high and it broke in 3 different places. It is tough to find a good screen protector that protects the phone and not degrade screen sensitivity. The setting to increase touch sensitivity which was available in the S5 is now gone so there is no way around this problem. The thoughtless design of this phone will not allow you to solve this problem. Either add a ballistic glass protector to the screen which solves the fragility of this phone but turns it into a useless phone since you have to press really hard to get the screen to respond, or not add a glass screen protector which leaves this phone subject to breaking sooner or later. It is as if Samsung intentionally designed the phone so that the screen will break (so they can sell more $200 'gorilla' glass screen'?) Other gimmicks are the 'Bixby' app which pops up constantly if you swipe the phone unintentionally in the wrong direction, and the edge screen which accidentally activates some menus while holding it. So you will have to try to hold this slippery phone by avoiding the front edges which increases the chance of dropping and breaking it."
"Amazon" "The best phone at any price right now.  I'm looking forward to next year when I may go for the Samsung Note.  I was a ten year iPhone user and finally lost patience with Tim Cook and his mediocre product development.  He's no Steve Jobs, not by a long shot...  This is the best phone and still has a proper headphone jack.  Until bluetooth headphones can make it a few days on one charge and can fit in my pocket as compactly as a small set of wired earbuds, I will continue to use a phone with a regular headphone jack.  With Apple and now Google Pixel phones committing to what is obviously a very controversial move, it seems like there may be a bigger agenda.  Maybe one of you software engineers can figure out what is the huge advantage of taking away a feature of the phone without adding to it.  Seems like maybe there is some larger reason, like maybe the bluetooth  headsets allow the companies to track you differently.  Maybe the headsets communicate with every wifi device in the world and tell them what you are doing.  I just don't get why they go out of their way to remove it, when it obviously still fits.  Samsung did it, but these other companies can't?  Got to be more to it."
"Amazon" "I love it.  It works like a charm.  I just wish they kept the LED notice lights where I could program the different apps and callers with as with the older versions.  You should download the Google keyboard, I kept hitting the period button instead of the space bar with the key board that it came with."
"Amazon" "After 10 years with Apple, bye bye Apple I'm done. After holding this phone you realize Apple had stopped innovating. This is by far the most beautiful, sleek fluid thin light weight designed phone ever to be offered. The infinity screen is stunning to the human eyes, the speed of the processor is just amazing."
"Amazon" "This is an amazing phone. I bought it outright and had it unlocked immediately on a CDMA plan. Took a trip and my carrier wasn't anywhere in the area. Found a local store that said only one was. He sold me a pay as you go SIM, which allowed me to do texting, but I blocked all the rest, and it worked perfectly. Just as promised by Samsung, it is broadcast band independent!"
"Amazon" "After being an iPhone user for several years, I decided to go back to Samsung again.I can assure you that this is the best smartphone I have owned.There is no comparison with IPhone.Pictures come out bright and vibrant.Flexibility is great to adjust to one's personal preferencesHaving a microSD is a great optionNo regrets. Get this one"
"Amazon" "Great upgrade from the S5. I switched to using Android from Apple since their phones hasn't refreshed in years. With the last Apple device being the iPhone 4, I gave it a go with Android. Initially hesitant to use Android starting with the HTC Evo, but eventually after testing out Samsung Galaxy line, I decided it's worth a shot. One thing I love about the S8 is the Infinity Display. Love how responsive it is, how thin the phone is, and how less susceptible the phone is to scratches. If you're looking for a tempered glass screen protector with this phone, I'd recommend the Galaxy S8 Screen Protector, Poetic [Full Coverage][HD Clear][Case Friendly][Anti-Fingerprint] Premium Edge-to-Edge Tempered Glass Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S8 (Clear). It covers most of the phone's screen except where the ear speakers, cameras, and iris scanner are."
"Amazon" "Amazon was having a $200 off deal on this when I purchased, which... is really good for a new phone, actually. I moved to this from the S5, and it's a big change. Overall this is very slick, fast, and high-performing. I like it much better than the S5--everything is faster and more responsive. The edgeless screen made me nervous at first, but the case I purchased seems to protect it okay. I've dropped it a couple times already from a distance of about 2-3 feet, face down and in its case, and it's been fine. If it breaks within a year, I'll update my review accordingly.My favorite feature is that its narrower--I like big phones, but I don't have big hands, so they can be exhausting to hold after a while. This one is just the right size to easily hold in one hand, while still having excellent screen real estate. It's not very heavy, which makes it easy to continuously read and interact on it one-handed, too, even with a heavier case.My least favorite feature is Bixby--while it has its uses, it really isn't that great at interacting with apps or hearing commands properly. It won't open non-Google apps on command, which is a huge pain, and half the time seems to mishear me even when I speak directly into the microphone and enunciate very clearly. Right now I solely use it to turn off the always on display at night, which seems like a waste for what could otherwise be a very powerful tool. It's actually kind of bizarre that it's as bad as it is, considering how many voice-controlled devices are on the market right now."
"Amazon" "I feel the need to warn people--do not buy this phone. I have been a lifelong Samsung Galaxy customer and was very excited when I got my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge about a year and a half ago. This phone is a hunk of junk and Samsung is wrong to continue selling it. Do your research (on help forums not websites selling the product) and you will see that there  are a myriad of common problems such as pixel failure, complete screen failure, SD card corruption--the list goes on. My problems began about three months in to having the phone. So much money was spent on it that I'm stuck with it for the foreseeable future. Samsung continues to deny responsibility for these faulty devices and will not send replacements or issue refunds. I bought mine through T-Mobile and because I'd previously had great experiences with Samsung Galaxy products, did not opt-in to purchase the warranty. I took the phone in to an independent electronics service center several months ago and had them replace the screen on the device for $390. This took care of the notorious \"pink line\" these phones get across the screen inditing an impending complete screen failure for about six weeks. The line returned in all it's obnoxious and infuriating glory. Again, I could go on endlessly with other complaints--but trust me you and anyone who glances at your phone won't be able to ignore the screen problem.I will not be buying a Samsung product again."
"Amazon" "Love the phone! Currently in Europe and works flawlessly with Orange. When I get back to the states I'll have an updated review for my provider there. Came in box with charger, headphones SIM card pusher out thingy, and adaptors for micro usb connections."
"Amazon" "I have had my Galaxy S8 for a little bit now and it has been great so far! I love how fast it is. I love the little things about it. The screen is absolutely phenomenal with the curve and screen to body ratio. The fingerprint scanner is great and I know majority don't like the position but for me it works amazing. It fits well in the hand and the cases feel just as nice. Luckily I have not dropped it yet so I hope if I ever do that it withstands the drop that would most likely be out of my pocket or about chest height. Switching from a Galaxy S5 to this S8 was a big change for me and I am glad I made it. Anyone who is thinking about getting this phone, I would say do it. It has everything you could want and more. I was torn between this and the Pixel 2 and they both have almost the same internal hardware but this has a 3.5mm headphone jack. You can't beat that because most companies are now doing away with it. I love not being able to plug in a dongle if I want to quickly listen to music or watch a short video. Honestly, I know I am bias towards Samsung products but everything I have had and also my friends/family have are amazing. They made great phones and appliances. Everything they make is top of the line and that's just the truth."
"Amazon" "This is quite a phone.It's extremely fast compared to our older Samsung S4.It's unlocked, so even when the kind folks at Verizon looked at me as if I was ignorant and gullible as they wondered out loud if the phone would work on the Verizon network, I knew it would (having read the reviews at Amazon) and I just told them to produce the free small sims card.  (Sorry about the lost commission guys, not.)If one already has a Samsung, it works in a similar fashion and a couple of days messing around with it is enough to gain a reasonably good working knowledge of the phone.  The Samsung site is quite informative and I've referred to it several times already.One strange thing is what feels like dueling systems on the phone.  You have the Google Android apps and simillar Samsung apps.  Many do the same things so choosing one or the other is really personal preference.I can't get over how fast this phone surfs the internet (I use Firefox) and how nicely photos are auto-arranged by date."
"Amazon" "BUY A CASE!!! If you read the bad reviews they all hate the phone because they said it is slippery and fragile!! My only advise is to buy a $20 case and the protection plan! Totally worth it! I bought mine a month ago and it is the best piece of technology I have ever owned. I am a HUGE Samsung fan and this is by far my favorite and has not disappointed me yet. This phone is amazing. It definitely beats out its Apple competitors and if you do not believe me then do your research because this phone is unprecedented. I LOVE it and it is worth every last penny! It will last for years to come and it is built to resist shatters and drops and it is even water resistant for up to 30 minutes under 5 feet of water!!! It is smooth to the touch and is extremely fast!! The memory usage is fantastic and the features it comes with are great. I recommend this to anyone buying a new phone...it is everything seen in the commercials and more. It has Bixby on it and she can do ANYTHING... I often use her feature to remind me where I parked or turn the lights off!!! Amazing technology and great phone!!!"
"Amazon" "If you consider purchasing Galaxy S7, S8, or Note 8 then you should read this review first. You may have heard from YouTubers that this is the best android device or the best they have ever used or best display on the market. Some of it is true, but there is more things that the YouTube reviewers don't discuss on their channel. Samsung is really slow when it comes down to pushing newer security updates and even slower pushing newer version of Android. The most important is constantly getting security updates, there are two major bugs that recently shake the smartphone industry, \"KRACK (Wi-Fi Bug)\" & \"BLUEBORNE (Bluetooth Bug)\" every single devices were affected including Apple devices. That said, Google (Nexus and Pixel) and Apple already patched their respective devices, but Samsung is still behind and that leaves vulnerable to hack. May be, you own a business and getting a device to run your business and would carry all the important documents, bank information, or any business related information, your information is at risk.Samsung has come a long way from their Galaxy S4 and Note 3 days, their software is much better now, but it is no where near close to Google's Pure Android that is currently being used on Nexus and Pixel. Samsung Experience/Touchwiz is bloated with unnecessary features and apps that runs in the background and eats up the battery. I have seen much better software experience on Google Pixel, and some other devices from Motorola and Sony. Some people love the Samsung's extra features and use them often, but others don't prefer and want something that is constantly being updated with security measures. There are other issues too related to Samsung Experience (former Touchwiz); I have found various bugs that are not annoying at all, and doesn't hinder day to day use, but they are there. Samsung needs to streamline the experience, and curate it towards what consumers really want and prefer. I do not recommend this device.If you have the device that is working perfectly fine, I suggest you wait it out until next Galaxy or Pixel 3 or get Sony Xperia XZ1. And if your device is broken and need something immediate and wants to spend money, it is entirely up to you."
"Amazon" "This phone is dope, it looks cool and it feels cool. Some people dont like where the finger print scanner is located but I dont really mind, I got used to it in a day but thats just me. This is one of the best phones I've had, its really fast and you can customize everything!One thing I would like to point out, wich I havent seen any other reviewer talk about, is that when I put my SIM card inside the S8 it dint activate my LTE service, so this is what I did, grab another phone that has a SIM card from your same carrier and copy that phones VPN setting to your S8, it worked for me.Id recomend buying a case if you are prone to droping phones like am, but I have a friend that has had her S8+ for 5 months without a case and has not droped it once, but i wouldnt take that chance.Edit: I added some pictures of what I did with the VPN, you just have to manually copy the information from another cell phone to your S8, hope this helps.Ps.My friend dropped her phone a few days ago lol, buy a case."
"Amazon" "Screen is EXTREMELY fragile.  Featuewise and style, this phone has everything.  But the screen cracks from simple drops.  In my case it went from my lap, bounced off my foot and flat on the floor.  Picked up and had multiple fractures throughout the screen.  The local repair shop wanted $400 just to repair it!  Sorry Samsung. Build a beautiful full featured phone that can take at least a little drop!  I would not recommend this unless you are willing to shell out extra for a good extended warranty.  From what I've learned, its not \"IF\" the screen will crack its a matter of \"WHEN\"."
"Amazon" "For context, in the past three years, I have used a Samsung Galaxy S5 and an LG G5 for my personal line, and an iphone 5s for my work line.  I have been using the S8 for a little while now and it's a mix of upgrades and downgrades from my previous phones.  Before I go into my review, I would like to point out that this review is for the second S8 phone that I got.  The first one (which I ordered from samsung.com) arrived defective, where a dime-sized portion of the touch screen was completely unresponsive out of the box.  While I'm sure every phone manufacturer will ship some defective devices, this has definitely lowered my confidence in Samsung's quality control.  Also, the Samsung customer support is the worst I've ever dealt with, and I spent 9 phone calls and over 13 hours trying to get the issue resolved.  If you do buy the device, buy from a third party (amazon, best buy, verizon, - just not samsung's online store) Here is my review of my second (non-defective) s8 device:1. The screen - First the good: It gets relatively bright outdoors, and is a high quality screen.  Now the bad:  The curve of the screen is the worst feature of the phone.  Sure, it makes the phone look fancy, but it actually makes the phone functionally worse.  When watching full screen videos, you will always have a  distracting glare on the curved edges of the screen.  This effectively means that every movie you watch in landscape mode will have the top and bottom of the movie distorted and annoying to watch.  Second, I have occasionally accidentally activated the back button with my hand when reaching over to the far edge of the screen, and this is definitely because the curve of the screen allows this.  The curve also makes it more difficult to get a glass screen protector that will make full contact with the screen.  And when you do find one, you'll still end up with a non-contact spot if you dont install it precisely in the right spot.  (I wasted a screen protector trying to find the right position.)2 - Performance - The performance of the phone is pretty great.  I haven't had any hiccups and everything seems to be running smoothly.3 - Battery Life - So far the battery is better than any of the phones I have previously had.  It gets me through the day with roughly 45% left at the end of the day.  That's from 7:30am to around 11pm.  I'd estimate I probably use around 4 to 5 hours of screen-on time during a full day.  I really dont like that the battery is not user-replaceable, but that's the world we live in now.  Based on how batteries degrade over time,  I suspect that a year from now, the battery life will not be as good as it is now, and I will have no way to replace it on my own.4 - Cameras - The front and back cameras work well.  I do miss the dual back camera that my LG G5 had, because once in a while a wide angle shot would have been useful.  If you have never used a dual back camera before, you obviously wont miss it.  But if you have, you might be in the same boat wishing that samsung had included it.5 - Fingerprint scanner - The offset location of the fingerprint scanner is odd.  If you use the phone without a case on it, this will probably annoy you as locating it by feel is not super easy.  I always have a case on it though, and this solves the problem.  With the case on it, my finger is immediately  able to find the edge of the cutout in the case, landing it directly on the scanner.  As long as your finger lands on it, the fingerprint scanner is actually quite responsive.6. Bixby - I have only used the voice assistant bixby a few times, so these are only my initial impressions.  I have used Bixby pretty successfully using voice commands to have it read and send text messages without me having to look at or touch the phone.  This is better than my experience with google now.  The bixby button is annoyingly easy to accidentally press though.  It hasn't been a consistent issue for me yet, but if my fingers dont learn to avoid it, I may start looking to see if there are any workarounds to remap or disable the button.7 - Build and design quality - This is where all of the professional review sites have gotten it wrong.  Most of the review sites praise this phone for \"feeling premium\" and having a great design. I'm sorry to say but they clearly have no understanding of what premium build quality is.  If they mean it feels like solid glass, yeah it does, because it is.  Both the front and back are glass.  Sure my fingers feel the glass too, but solid and smooth doesn't mean premium.  What my brain knows when it's holding glass is that it's holding something fragile.  I'm an engineer, and this is how I would design a phone if I wanted it to shatter in a drop.  The curved screen makes it worse, as it's significantly more likely that an impact will occur against the glass.  Also, because of the curve, there are no phone cases that will wrap around the sides of the phone.  This means even with a case there is a good chance you will damage your phone if you drop it.  If you buy this phone, you should probably also get a accidental damage warranty, and expect to pay something like a $100 deductible on top of that if/when you drop the phone.  I hope this design fad goes away, because I would much prefer a phone with a flat screen and an aluminum or plastic back.8 - Water Resistance - The phone is supposed to be water resistant, but honestly I didn't have the guts to check, so I'll have to take their word for it.Overall - This is a mix of good and bad features.  The problem is, there aren't that many device options for a Verizon user who prefers android.  I would have gone with the LG G6, but after the build quality and GPS issues that I (and many other people, apparently) experienced with the G5, I dont really want to buy another LG phone.  The Moto Z2 series looks good, and I'd love to have a phone I don't have to be concerned about dropping, but the phone is bigger than I'd like.  The S8 is a nice size.  Given the other options out there, I don't regret my s8 purchase, but I don't love the phone, and I'm not confident that I wouldn't have been happier with the Moto Z2 or G6."
"Amazon" "The phone I received from this Amazon seller is an unlocked Verizon phone.  It may or may not have been \"unlocked by Samsung\", but that claim is certainly misleading as it leads you to believe that you are receiving a generic universal phone.  Verizon is CDMA, the other more common carriers are GSM and they are not compatible, though some phones offer some of the frequencies of both types.  When I put my AT&T sim card in it, it seemed to work, but the display came up with a Verizon welcome page and there was an annoying \"not a Verizon sim card\" error message in the notification tray.  You could force the error to go away, but it always came back when you powered up the phone.  I did not trust that I would get true GSM performance out of a Verizon phone and might experience slow or degraded performance due to a shortage of available frequencies so I returned the phone and ordered a true unlocked generic phone directly from Samsung.  It cost more but the peace of mind is worth it.  For over $700 including tax you shouldn't have to put up with nuisance messages in your new phone, potentially degraded performance or deceptive advertising.1/11/2018 -  Received my new phone that I ordered from directly from Samsung today.  It is a true generic phone without any carrier software installed and very streamlined.  Now that I have seen what a new phone should look like I can also add to my original review that the phone I received from \"Electronic Deals\" via Amazon was NOT a new phone, or had at least been previously opened because it was missing a few of the accessories were included with the phone I received today and it also had fingerprints all over it. I recommend paying the extra $75 and getting a truly new phone that is universal directly from the Samsung store."
"Amazon" "So many other reviewers have posted exemplary write-ups detailing the features, benefits, photos of the S8.  I won't even try to compare. All I can tell you is that I needed to replace my 3-year-old Galaxy Alpha, so when the Galaxy S8 went on sale over Labor Day weekend, I walked into a big box retailer (whose name rhymes with \"guest guy\") intending to buy one of the lesser priced prior year models like the G7. However when I walked into the display area, the S8 winked at me, it was love at first sight, I was stunned and floored by the beauty, grace, forward-looking design, advanced features including VR, and vibration control video camera performance that reminded me (in my simplistic estimation) of Hollywood steadicam, a far cry from my prior Alpha's performance in that regard.  (Plus, simply, when it comes to Android, where obsolescence unfortunately happens rather quickly, newer is better, because it gives you longer usable life.)  I bought.  I haven't looked back.  The two of us have been joined at the hip (literally) for almost 2 months, as I mated it with a very inexpensive, minimal size holster case that visually recedes out of the way to allow the stunning beauty of this phone to shine (while continuing to buffer it from shocks).Phone setup was a breeze, as I merely unplugged the micro SIM from my Galaxy Alpha, plugged it into the S8, and my cellular carrier was auto-configured by the S8, so you really can't hope for anything cleaner than that. Plus the simplified migration utility that came with the S8  copied over my files and photos, my contacts lists and more, from my prior phone.I spent a fair amount of time optimizing app power use.  The S8 now uses minimal power while I'm out and about, and at night it takes no more than a few minutes to bring to full charge again, ready for next day.A chief buying criteria for me was camera performance. I found amazing praise in the comparative reviews published at GSMArena, a prominent factor in my willingness to purchase the S8.  Camera performance matches or exceeds reviewers' expectations.Unlock methods:  fingerprint / face scan / iris scan / voice scan / nearby device detection / draw pattern / type a PIN.  (I've used face, fingerprint, pattern.)  Fingerprint wasn't working for a while but Samsung fixed with a firmware push (Nov 2018).I'm a guy who has consciously avoided the phablet phenomenon as I can't imagine carrying a massive hunk of hardware wherever I go. The S8 has surprised me with its incredibly large viewable area, while still maintaining a manageably slim and narrow carrying profile, the perfect fusion of function, beauty and utility, in my opinion.Read some of the other reviews, see it for yourself, and allow yourself to believe that there truly can be such an exceptional piece of engineering.So far, it's been a joy ride."
"Amazon" "Listen to me right now when I say the S8 is a good phone. Holy crap its amazing super fast HD display this phone is beautiful! Mobile Internation LLC is a trustable place to buy your S8 look at the seller he sells new S8's with no lies or gimmicks. The S8 Got here in one-day I'm playing around with it currently and I'm sure it will gather a lot of attention. If I have any issues ill post them here. This is the type of phone you want to show off people."
"Amazon" "This is a great phone in terms of its power and UI... Pretty much any phone in this price point is going to be amazing, and it definitely fits the bill in terms of specs and performance.However, it is probably the most fragile phone ever made.  I have never broken a phone in my life, and I drop my phone as much as the next person.  You can tell the second you hold this phone that it is amazingly fragile.  The whole thing is made of Gorilla glass, which is known to spider crack extremely easily.  Crazy that this design was actually approved, I don't care how strong you think your glass is it will never be more durable than metal/plastic.  Any benefits are overshadowed by the fact this is the most fragile phone ever to hit the market.The design of the phone makes it way easier for it to slip out of your pocket.  I can't ever remember having my phone fall out of my pocket (I am sure it has happened, but nothing became of it IE breaks), but I had to constantly be aware of my phone in my pocket/take it out and put it on the table because when I sat it immediately started to slip out.  I think it is because this phone is larger vertically and smaller horizontally compared to most phones.  I have owned many phones, and this has never been a problem until the moment I put this phone in my pocket.My phone fell out of my pocket while sitting, it was a drop between 2 and 2.5 feet, and it cracked in 2 corners, one corner that was not even apart of the initial impact.  The fact a corner that had no major impact whatsoever (a fall of maybe 4 inches after the first corning hit the ground) cracked was alarming to say the least.  Shame on me for not having the case on it (I literally had the phone for 3 hours, did not make it home yet and my case I purchased was at home)...  However, few weeks later it slipped out again, with a case on, and the whole front of the phone shattered.... Again a drop no more than 2.5 feet.Insurance on this phone is an absolutely must, or I guarantee you will not own this phone in a working fashion very long.  My S5 fell 2 stories and didn't get a scratch. This phone fell 2 feet and spider cracked to a point where I need to get it repaired.  One of the most important aspects of a cell phone is its durability and ability to handle everyday life and people where accidents happen at one point or another is guaranteed.  The fact you have to treat this phone with the delicacy of an infant makes it almost a burden to own.Between the failings of the S7 and the beyond poor durability of the S8, this lifelong Android user may switch to Iphone my next phone purchase a few years down the line"
"Amazon" "Wifey's an Apple-Head ... I'm Team Samsung ... the debate continues.  She recently upgraded to the iPhone 7 Plus (Red Special Edition) ... & it's 'nice' ... but when I received my new Galaxy S8+, I was instantaneously reminded of the style, quality & excellence that only Samsung can deliver.  It's not even close.* FYI ... I purchased a Verizon Prepaid SIM Card, as a suggested add-on through Amazon after adding the phone to my Cart.  The Verizon SIM Card is a 'Verizon Wireless SIM Kit Prepaid Sim Card - (Moto G & Any Verizon Branded Phone)'.  When I attempted to activate the phone w/ SIM Card through the Verizon Wireless website, the activation would not complete & Verizon claimed I needed a 'Samsung' SIM Car Kit.  However, my wife completed the activation steps that accompanied the SIM Card Kit (the instructions on the packaging), & the activation completed flawlessly."
"Amazon" "Don't be scared to buy this phone. This will work with Verizon. I went to a local store and the dumb sales girls gave me a dirty look and said it won't work. I asked her to still try. She typed some numbers and told me it's not working. So I just bought a sim card from them and called Verizon customer support. The lady that was on the phone got mine to work with in 10-15 mins.So if you are worried that this might not work with Verizon, don't be scared. It works. Just buy a new sim card and call the customer support instead of going into a store."
"Amazon" "After using an old phone with such a large bezel, the switch to the Galaxy S8 was spectacular. I could not stop staring at the screen when I first saw it. There is just so much of it! After using this phone for a couple months, I have created a list of what i love the most and dislike the most of this product.Pros:-Screen has amazing brightness, resolution and size.-Cameras are spectacular. Images are sharp and crisp.-Opposed to contrary belief, the fingerprint scanner on the back is easy to reach and is very responsive-Battery life is very good, also charges very quickly with the included Fast Charger-Has Video Enhancement and Game Enhancement modes for when you need extra brightness, performance and screen resolution.Cons:-Feels very delicate (easily solved with a case)-Glass on the back so it is a fingerprint magnet (easily solved with a case)-Bixby Button can be confused as Volume Down button, also Bixby software is not the best at the moment but it is a new product and has lots of potential.Overall great phone and great experience so far. Would Recommend!"
"Amazon" "I can't say anything bad about this phone. My Nexus 5x died on me and I had to find a replacement. There was a lot of, \"Wait for the new pixel phone\" talk going around my friend circle, but the S8 just looked really good! And, so far, its been a great experience! The phone is light, sleek, feels good in hand, feels good in pocket, is more sturdy than I had thought, is fast, great photos, great interface and has an expandable SD slot (which my nexus didn't have, so, improvement).The biggest caveat I've had so far is the Bixby button. I'm glad that Samsung has added a \"disable\" feature, but remapping that button would be great. Beyond that, love the phone :)"
"Amazon" "-Bottom line, this phone is a piece of junk for the price.-I can't delete pictures anymore... I've tried to delete the same picture 6 times now and it keeps showing up when I go back to my gallery.-Everyday I have at least one update of a new glitch, flaw, or problem with this phone.... this is my most updated review because of how terrible this phone is.-New text message notifications do not go away. I've opened the message twice and closed it and it's still telling me the message is new...-Received a notification today that I've never seen before. The app \"SYSTEM\" was causing problems and needed to be closed... don't I need the system app?-Power button does not function, it takes at least 2-3 presses to get it to recognize the press.-Screen was heavily tinted red right out of the box, I needed to adjust the color settings to turn the red completely off.-\"Person is typing...\" text box is right on top of the most recent text so you cannot read it.-FINALLY, they gave an option to disable the Bixby button, now I just have a completely useless button on my phone. Maybe it could be remapped to be a fully functional power button since my phone doesn't have one?-Pictures sent via text message take 5+ minutes to send, fail, and then resend in a minute.-Battery life is getting worse with every update, I used to be able to use my phone over a 48 hour period without charging. Now I have to charge it every 24 hours or less.-Automatic brightness that adjusts to your patterns is a nice feature. However, in sunlight it defaults to max brightness and you cannot change it. Compared to the S7 this phone is nowhere near as bright. I frequently have problems seeing the screen at max brightness, blacks blend together and any dark movies are unwatchable.-Audio is acceptable, you can't expect much from a single speaker on the bottom right of the phone... Volume levels are poor. Any background noise beyond a fan will make it difficult if not impossible to hear dialogue in a movie at max volume.-Auto rotate works when it wants to, never when you want it to.-Word prediction and swyping on this phone is as bad if not worse than previous Galaxy models. I think it is worse because I'm getting strings of letters that are not even English. I never lift my finger off, and swipe very common words, and end up with gibberish. Some examples: planning changes to pls no do, sending changes to section, doing changes to don, what changes to Wyatt, checking to cur king, stay to starry, anything to abutting, constantly to com subtly, maybe to mary be, keep to Leo, on to oob, something to sobering, today to fist, someone to sombrero get..."
"Amazon" "I will simply add to the \"I love it\" category but I do want to add something that might not be known. Samsung is a bit deceptive in their advertising of this phone. The infinity display is NOT really infinity. Notice they overexpose the edges on the image shown for this product. This is to hide the fact that the display does not really go from edge to edge. It goes over the curve slightly but there is a noticeable edge around the display. It is not technically an Infinity display. That's a bit of a letdown, but not a game changer for me in saying I still love the phone. Mostly because the camera is great and the battery is sick, that is awesome."
"Amazon" "Long time iPhone user that was moved to try the Galaxy S8+ due to its large screen, beautiful design, and deep price discounts. Unfortunately, I had to return the S8+ after just a week and a half because it was unable to maintain a band 12 T-Mobile LTE connection. T-Mobile blamed Samsung, Samsung blamed T-Mobile, so I just returned the thing. I went back to my iPhone 7+ ready to put the whole S8+ experience down as a failed experiment. I originally ordered the S8+ from Samsung's website. The user experience of the purchase and return, compared to Apple, was crude and confusing. I had to call Samsung order support and tech support multiple times, every interaction with Samsung was awful. Everything I was told by support was wrong and they never followed through with anything they said they would do.But here's the thing, as I went back to using my iPhone 7+, iOS just felt so... boring. And the iPhone 7+ design, which I had previously liked, looked so... dated.Now let's face it, Android is a mess. Duplicated functionality, inconsistent UX, and the Android upgrade and update situation is pathetic. But Android felt exciting! And boy do I miss that S8 screen and overall phone design.Then there is this year's Apple contenders. Sure, Apple hasn’t announced anything yet, but with all the leaks we pretty much know that two of the iPhones will continue the tired 3-year old iPhone 6 design, and the new AMOLED iPhone with that ugly notch?Have you seen the leaks of the Galaxy Note 8? What a stunner!I'll wait for Apple to officially announce, but if the leaks and rumors end up being true - call me a glutton for punishment - I’m all over that Galaxy Note 8!Update: 9/19/17 - now that the iPhone X has been announced and the Note 8 is available, I bought another S8+, and this one is functioning just fine. I don't like the iPhone X's look (the notch), the price, and many of its new features aren’t things I would ever use. I didn' see enough bang for the additional bucks to choose the Note 8 over the S8+.  With the Galaxy S8+, I think I have the best looking phone on the market today at a reasonable price (got it on sale), even if I have to put up with Android's goofiness."
"Amazon" "I didn't think much of this phone as I was waiting for the Note 8. (Was a Note 4 user just 2 days before) But as the Note 8 became more disappointing with each leak, and esspecially after it's release with no embedded fingerprint scanner and a smaller battery than the S8+, I decided to look at the S8+. It was cheaper, has the same features as the Note 8 and, I believe it's safe to say, a better battery life. It was clear that this phone was next on the throne. While I wouldn't have the pen, I had to admit to myself that I hardly used the pen for the Note 4 anyway. No real loss there, so I ended up saving myself a few hundred bucks.As for the phone itself, I am very impressed. The display is so beautiful- especially with the infinity display. Textures look almost too real and the colors are so sharp and eye pleasing. Even in videos. I was also impressed with the battery life. Throughout the day I used the Note 4 and S8+ fairly equally and to my surprise, from 9am to 3pm the S8+ left me with 70% from 100% while my Note 4 had to be charged again from 100%.Customization is a must for me with any phone and this phone has outdone my expectation for any phone. Of course it has the basic customizations, but this phone goes so deep into it that I still haven't been able to see all that you can do with it after 2 days of use when I usually go through everything on a phone within a day.No phone is perfect and there's usually at least one thing I won't like about a phone. The ONLY thing I don't like about this phone is the placement of the speaker. It's located at the bottom of the phone in the right side, and that's a problem because I'm a gamer and I occasionally watch YouTube which I preferably use in landscape mode which requires that you turn the phone horizontally. When I hold the phone naturally in that position, I end up covering the speaker which forces me to readjust my grip to a more uncomfortable one.That being said, this phone is still the best one I could have purchased at this time and I do NOT regret buying it whatsoever."
"Amazon" "I was looking for a new Android phone and it came down to this or the Pixel 2. The Pixel 2 doesn't have a headphone jack so I opted for the s8. This is a great phone! I'm sure there are more detailed reviews out there, but overall, I love this phone. Smooth interface, beautiful form factor, headphone jack, no problems using all my apps. I like the unusual screen shape, which is a bit longer than typical, which means you get more screen space without having to deal with a super-wide phone. It does overheat more easily than my earlier Nexus 5 (to be fair, I accidentally took it into a sauna so this is an unusual use case) and there are times when the touch screen isn't quite as responsive as I'd like, but it's a solid phone for the price. I've used multiple apps and functions, hooked it up to Bluetooth speakers and headphones (regular and Bluetooth), connected to multiple WiFi ports, etc. And it's handled all of that pretty comfortably.It's slim and the screen is big so people recommend a case. I bought a super thin Humixx case (red!) that I like, and no problems."
"Amazon" "This phone is absolutely beautiful to hold and it has a sleek, 'new-car' feeling!Over all the functionality is similarly comparable across the Galaxy phones (4/7edge) with exception to few obvious changes (upgrades?) to the phone.  In the quest for the slick, they opted to take away the 'Home' button, which my fingers - as well as other iPhone/Galaxy users - have gotten subconsciously programmed to press, only to find that there are no buttons. I would need to 'swipe up' from the bottom of the screen and a virtual 'Home’ button, 'back' function and 'multi-window' interface becomes accessible.This phone has a Samsung Note8-esque interface (not to mention, the screen size difference between those two is just 0.1 inch!). So outside of the Stylus, S8+ promises to be just as versatile in its use!  One other function they did away with - because of the ‘Home’ button change - I have to use the Volume down+Power button to take a screenshot.  Using my thumb+middle finger to squeeze a shot may get some getting used to!The 3500mAh Battery holds well through the day (I use it heavily and I only seem to be down to about 35% by dinner time) and the only thing that seems to 'overheat' the product and/or shorten the battery life is when I am using it with VR.When I first had the Samsung S4, I was able to capture image of a beautiful low-light sunset (for which I was selected winner for a photography submission) and ever since then I’ve been HOOKED!  I took a photo of another sunset! This one was taken without any special filter and yet it beautifully captures the layers of the fading colors - S8+ exceeds it’s low-light capabilities of it's predecessors!  In addition, there are some new photo functions (swipe left in ‘Camera’). I love that as an inner (or Yelp) ‘Foodies’, I have my very own food filter to snap as many lunch or dinners as I pleased!  Use the 'Pro' function and I am Wow'd with the filter package it comes with!Getting an unlocked phone will give me the freedom to choose mobile network not just in the US but Internationally - which is great, as an international photographer to travel with and it sure beats carrying around multi handsets!  As an unlocked phone, this Samsung S8+ has both CDMA and GSM capabilities.  I went with a CDMA network, and the company blocked my ‘Talk and Surf’ function. On the bright side, CDMA does seem to preserve the battery life better so it’s a toss up!As the saying goes, ya either will Love it or Hate it, like Kimchee.  Take it from a diehard Macgirl that switched out of the iPhone to a Samsung.  It was worth it and haven’t gone back!   "
"Amazon" "The Samsung Galaxy S8+ is stunning from every angle. It’s easily the  best Android phone I have ever held.The best display on the market currently.Great software experience.The camera works in every light and takes the best pictures.Reliable hardware and wonderful design, very fast.It feels great in the hand.Setup takes about few minutes then you get a software update, mine is unlocked and works great with Verizon.Bixby works OK as an assistant but you can always use Google assistant and it works great.It is an engineering masterpiece, outstanding performance and the finest big smartphone that you can buy currently.it comes with high end headphones."
"Amazon" "Im coming from 3 generations of iPhones and 4 generations of iPods. The black friday deal triggered the move for me just to test the waters.Good things that stand out:screen is unreal. The most beautiful thing ive ever seen.great customization. everything runs smooth.128gb sd card 256 compatibleCons-nothing comes close to imessage.camera has lag and choppiness.Overall im happy I made the switch. I have customized every inch of this phone and it is beautiful. After getting used to the s8 screen, when I pick up my SE it feels like a dinosaur."
"Amazon" "I bought this S8 phone directly from Samsung as they were having a big sale just before Thanksgiving, plus they were giving $400 rebates on my old phone (a Samsung S7 I purchased from Verizon).  My old S7 was in great condition, but ... it was locked into Verizon, and despite what their offices will tell you, it's difficult to buy a SIM chip overseas to purchase service in order to avoid Verizon's high cost international plans.  When the phone arrived, I put in a new 64mb memory chip, enabled Wifi, logged into my Gmail account, and almost immediately Google started sending my apps to the new phone.  I spent an hour or two recreating my pages, and then the dreaded moment arrived - time to move the Verizon SIM from the old to the new, and either go online or call Verizon to associate the new S8 with my old SIM/phone number.  But ... amazingly, within 30 seconds of installing the SIM, the S8 became fully operational and was using my phone number!  Easy, peasy.  No logging into Verizon, wading thru their Customer Svc dept - nada.  It just worked!  So, how do I like the new S8?  Well, I could do without the curved glass, and don't like doing without the home button and the quick unlocking of the phone, but ... the battery life seems to be longer, although it's still a bit early.  Am finding that if I'm going to be away from electrical power it's best to disable the biggest battery hog of all time - Facebook.  It doesn't hurt to disable it, as it comes roaring back when you open it, but while in disabled mode it's not constantly polling the Mother Ship and drawing the battery down.  Oh, and the camera seems to be a wash versus the S7.  At some point, and maybe we've reached it - smartphones will have a level of perfection which - for all practical purposes - can't be exceeded.  Sorta like PC's.  About the only thing Samsung and Apple can do, IMHO, is to compete on the basis of price.  Tis inevitable.  Look at what's happened to the cost of laptops and desktops."
"Amazon" "Great phone for the most part. Broke the glass on the back the first day by inadvertently leaning on it while it was in my pocket. Also chipped the back when it dropped 2 feet onto concrete. GET A CASE IF YOU GET THIS PHONE! Also, I wish the fingerprint scanner was on the front instead of the back of the phone so you could unlock it without picking it up."
"Amazon" "Love it!!! I accidentally dropped it in my dogs bowl of water, fully submerged, two days after I received it and 1 month later still works like a champ, no glitches,  nothing."
"Amazon" "Great phone, first unlocked we've ever bought, and it was a great move.  It's great but not perfect.PROSExcellent performance with all apps, very snappyBeautiful screen (though very delicate)Light, great battery lifeCONS* Phone is slippery wherever you touch/grab it.  Hard to hold onto, unless you get a case, which you probably should.* Bixby assistant is very obtrusive and even has its own dedicated hard button on the left, which you will be mistakenly hitting often (you can sign into Samsung and set the button to do nothing, but you can't seem to reassign the button to be useful, or completely get rid of Bixby).* Edge screen design is a novelty and more difficult to use than a standard screen.  I find myself having to try multiple times to get the right thing selected with my finger, because of the wrapping edges of the screen* Doesn't seem to have a widget for flashlight built in, like my S5 had"
"Amazon" "I had iphone 6+ and changed to the S8. I did not like the over size and weight iphone 6+ and I did not like the small screen size of the iphone 6. The S8 is much smaller and lighter and has a bigger screen which is amazing. The display is way better than iphone 6+ and also is OLED which iphone doesn’t have and maybe the next gen iphone will have on its most expensive model. Pictures and movies look far superior than on the iphone. I needed and unlocked phone so when I travel to other countries I just drop in a sim card from that country and not have to pay roaming charges etc.The S8 supports wireless charging in which I bought an after market wireless charger stand for $16 and works excellent and also can charge while on its side which is nice when watching movies. The screen looks like miniature movie theatre when watching full length movies and most movies fill the entire screen.The memory can expand to 2 TB when available but I just stuck in 128 gig sd card for now. I have lots of FLAC lossless music and it takes up lots of space and also have lots of HD movies. By the way Apple does not support FLAC lossless music which is the most prolific lossless music format available. And also the S8 video is 4k so that takes a lot of memory. You need to up the resolution in settings as the default is not the highest.The benchmarks show that the S8 is twice as fast as the iphone 6+. The battery life seems good but did not have it long enough. Some people say that the battery life is average but with the much higher speed and higher resolution graphics, the tradeoff of slightly less battery life is fine with me. Also the weight factor and size is important to me.It has a built in pulse sensor and O2 sensor which works good and can calculate stress level also.When plugged into my Dell I7 notebook it sees the internal memory and the SD card so easy to load files from the computer. However when plugged into my Acer Aspire I5 desk computer it sees the S8 but not the internal or external memory. Also when using my wifi file transfer app it only can access the internal memory and does not see the external memory.The fingerprint sensor works excellent and after a few times I had no problem putting my finger on the sensor and not accidently on the camera lens. I don’t know why people complain as it is a no brainer after a few times only. I find the fingerprint sensor to be very fast and 100% accurate. However I use the retina sensor to unlock the phone and works excellent also and very fast and 100% accurate so I don’t use the fingerprint sensor unless I have to.I do not know how the new iphone 8 will compare of course but with the new iphone OS 11 you won’t be able to run any 32 bit programs so many programs will not work after the upgrade. The S8 also retains the headphone jack which is important to me and apple got rid of it of course forcing you to use and adapter. The S8 uses the  C type usb connector which is much better and more robust than the micro usb that most phones come with and now appears to be the industry standard for portable devices.The phone is also waterproof to a certain extent but I did not test it and not sure how water will not get into the headphone jack. The earphones that come with the phone are throw away type but maybe ok for phone call and with good earphone and or headphone the sound is excellent with FLAC lossless music.I like the fact that I can open multiple windows and switch back and forth quickly which Apple OS can’t do and also there is always a back button which somehow Apple feels is not necessary so going back to a previous page etc. is impossible unless the app itself contains a back button. It is also easier to add items in groups than the Apple OS. Lots of other features makes this phone easier to use and manage than the Apple OS.As soon as you get this phone you need to buy a case and a good screen protector obviously due to the front and back being glass. The case would make the size a little bigger but not as big and cumbersome as the 6+.I have not used the Bixby and the left Bixby button should be user programmable so the user has control as to what you want it to do. There are other options to use other than Bixby of course.To conclude, there is no perfect phone but this has the fewest problems of the phones I’ve encountered up until now and I bought this on sale making the price much cheaper than the comparable iphone also."
"Amazon" "This is a good phone with some major issues.First good:--Very nice display and good sound--Good camera, especially in low light.--Looks really good.Now to the bad:--Some of the applications that used to run before without problems, now take huge resources and stop working, e.g. requires rebooting the phone every time I want to use Amazon Prime Video.--Display while good is fingerprint and dust magnet and all these things reflect in sunlight making viewing experience less than optimal, to put it mildly.--It may be T-Mobile specific but data connection settings do not include both 4th and 6th standards for the network, so I had to create my own setting for it-- The biggest thing the phone front camera and back flash (as well as all camera software) stopped working after only two months. After analyzing the issue (Samsung has internal hardware checking menu), I found out that it was hardware issue. It was confirmed and fixed by Samsung center in Manhattan (Guys at \"Samsung 837\" are great. If anyone lives in NYC Metro area, you should visit Samsung 837: great service, great experience and they do not try to sell, they just show the products and explain)."
"Amazon" "I can not say enough about this phone. It is as perfect as a company has done creating the perfect smartphone for me.This phone is PERFECT in my hand. Its screen is big but you wouldn't be able to tell because it is in such a small footprint. The phone is light. The worst thing about the design is how slippery it is. But a skin or case will fix that.The bezelless display makes it look leagues above every phone out there other then the Pixel 2, Essential Phone, iPhone X and LG V30. To me however the iPhone X and the S8 are tied aesthetically. They both represent the next generations of what is a smartphone. I almost bought a LG G6 before I even held this phone and thank god I didn't buy it. It doesn't compare aesthetically at all. I can list many reasons why this phone is better then all phones other then the Note 8. The V30 is debatable. And the iPhone X isn't available to the masses yet.The screen is AMAZING. Which everyone knows Sammy Mobile creates the best screens around. However, I came from a Note 5 to this thing and could instantly see the difference. Which is crazy because I didn't think the screen could get any better at a QHD resolution (this screen is only QHD+ because of the 16:9 aspect ratio).At first I thought I would hate the aspect ratio. I love squarish phones so much and prefer my displays to be more square then rectangle. But I actually got used to it fast. Content on this looks so good with that aspect ratio. Youtube, Netflix, Amazon Video and the native Samsung video app all support a zoom in function. At first I was thinking this would be terrible because it would look stretched and things would be missing I needed to see. But no. They did an AMAZING job with the zoom feature. It's the reason I was finally sold on this aspect ratio. With out it I would have never gotten this phone.The cameras are amazing. The pixel is the only one that compares. Even the iPhone X looks night and day compared to this phone. It may be preference but shots from this phone are so much better imo.I waited a month before I wrote this review to see if the phone would start slowing down or stuttering. Nope! I run a launcher and a custom notification shader and my phone doesn't even seemed bothered. My Note 5 slowed down and sputtered when I customized the heck out of it. My S8+? No problem.The fingerprint scanner, iris scanner and facial recognition are all amazing. I have used them all and had no problems. Yes photos can trick facial recognition. However I am way more worried about a stranger robbing me or stealing it then I am of someone I know taking it. So facial recognition to me, has gotten a bad rep on this phone. As well as the fingerprint scanner. I pull out my phone conveniently with my finger in the same spot as the fingerprint scanner. So to me this design works. When I am using it two handed I just slide my left hand up and it really isn't that bad. But it is the biggest complaint on this phone. That says A LOT!Battery life has been phenomenal. I crank it to max brightness. Wifi is usually on, NFC and bluetooth. I am still averaging like 4-5 1/2 screen on time.With a bezelless gorgeous 2K HDR screen, 4 gb Ram, Samsung Pay, the cameras, the security features (Samsung Knox, Pass, Secure Folder and the various biometric locks ), the light skin over Android, the specs that future proof it (LTE-A/LTE+, Bluetooth 5.0), big battery with great longevity (battery cycle count a lot higher then all phones before it) and wireless charging, HEADPHONE Jack, exedra exedra this is as perfect as a cell phone as you can get imo. Front facing stereo speakers are the only missing feature I can think of. But even then the speaker on this is really nice.As you can tell I love this phone. Probably my favorite peice of tech since I got my iPad Pro 9.7. Definitely by this. If you don't get a V30, Note 8 or iPhone X instead if that's your thing.Easiest 5/5 rating I have ever given."
"Amazon" "I have 2 of these, one for me and one for my girlfriend.  They both are flawless in performance and features.  I see some reviews complain on here about features that can be easily disabled.... which makes no sense... one if you dont like a feature it can be disabled ( bixby, always on display)  but why pay $500+ for a phone to not get the most out of it.Pros:1. Battery life is amazing, i can have this game playing a game for hours with brightness and graphics all the way up and then look at my battery life, and it still be 50%2. charge time is better, with the provided charger, and pugin  it takes less than 2 hours to charge 0-75%.3. Bixby... although many dislike her, this is the best attempted AI ever provided.  It learns what apps i use and what times i sleep. always watching but a Great mobile AI... want to say the first I believe. (yeah siri isn't AI, it doesn't learn based on past inputs as bixby does.)"
"Amazon" "The Samsung Galaxy S8+ is one of the largest phones in the market yet it is hard to believe how slim it is. The Infinity Display makes for a huge beautiful screen, which is great for multi-tasking, watching videos and editing pictures, without the distraction of buttons. The size can be a drawback as it is hard to use only one hand unless you activate the one-handed mode. The increased battery size gets me through the day, better than previous models. Having used the fingerprint authentication on my phone for several years, I was a bit disappointed in the placement of the S8’s scanner. It is hard to reach, requires me to pick up my phone and I keep smudging my camera. However, I switched over to the iris scanner and it is amazingly fast. I wear glasses and it has worked with them in various lighting conditions with only an occasional adjustment. Some additional features are included with the camera, such as masks and stickers, similar to other social photo apps, and one unique feature is using Bixby search. Though it is not 100% accurate, it does a decent job of finding similar objects just by the picture. It is actually kind of humorous to see what other things it comes up with, like my buddies dog was identified as a Labrador retriever, horse and cattle. He does seem as big as a horse or cow though. Bixby is an interesting feature that is Samsung’s attempt at competing with Apple’s Siri and improving on their own S-Voice. With the dedicated button you can avoid the usual opening commands of “Hey …” or “OK …” and go straight into what you need. You can still use the voice command of “Hi Bixby” to get things done if you choose to, but I prefer to just hold the button and start dictating. Bixby does all of the usual commands to help you easily send messages, place calls, set timers and reminders. You can also get Samsung Reward points by using Bixby and gaining experience points. This includes just playing around with Bixby and asking some ridiculous questions like “rap for me.” In return your earned points can get you gift cards or chances to win prizes. Bixby will also read off the time, weather and news highlights aloud for your alarms, a nice touch when waking up in the morning."
"Amazon" "I was expecting something amazing after upgrading from my old Note 4, and this falls short of my expectations. Battery life is disappointing, even with most of the apps \"sleeping\". It's the one thing that needs to be addressed and fixed - a larger battery cell on a phone this big is probably something that most consumers would be OK with. I also don't really like the absence of a \"home\" button, and the Bixby button on the left side of the phone is RIDICULOUS. You think you're pressing the volume button, and instead you get the Bixby screen pop up. I've yet to use it - Google Assistant works like a charm on this phone and wakes up with \"OK Google\".On the plus side, this phone qualifies for Sprint's 1 year free unlimited bring your own phone plan."
"Amazon" "I found the opportunity to test the Galaxy S8+ fully expecting to have mediocre reactions to it. After a few weeks, I can confidently say this phone is pretty damn good.The biggest issue I had with samsung phones is the cumbersome overlay and bloatware that seemed to bring the phone to a grinding halt. My previous experience with the Note 4 wasn't lost on me. It worked well at first but lag made it a chore to use. It's only been a few weeks but I've noticed no lag. Apps open zippily; the camera is quick to use. No longer does it seem like there are a million useless apps to clog things up. The new Touchwiz interface seems much more sleek and the Samsung software actually useful. Whichever apps you don't like, you can simply disable. In fact, I find notifications that the phone has disabled unused apps running in the background very reassuring.The display is beautiful. Stunning image quality. I love watching videos on it. Yes, samsung tends to oversaturate images but you can choose to turn this down. Blue light display helps at night to reduce strain on my eyes. Edge-to-edge infinity screen with minimal bezels makes this a beauty to look at, and I receive many compliments on it.Picture quality is great on the camera. Low-light is OK, but day-and-night over my previous iPhone 6. I miss the dual-lens available on the Note 8, but for a single lens, this is great.Battery life is excellent. I use it pretty heavily for music, chat and web browsing through the day and I never run low. If I need a charge, fast-charge gives me a lot of juice with just 10-15 minutes plugged in.Cons:Bixby isn't great. It doesn't seem to wake up half the time with voice commands. While it's not necessarily bad, it offers no real advantages in my daily use to Google Assistant, which conveniently is also available on this device.Fingerprint scanner. Takes getting used to but with a case, is much more easy to find. Not a deal-breaker by any means.Speaker is terrible. There's a single speaker at the bottom of the phone which is easy to accidentally cover up. I use headphones most of the time, however, and as this is now one of the few phones that still has a headphone jack, is no problem.This is by far the best phone I've had, and I'm glad I went with this over the iPhone X which is going for nearly double the price."
"Amazon" "Had the S7 Edge and loved it. S8 plus? home button. Or should I say lack of a home button. Now it's on the screen and way to easy to touch.  Once again in an attempt to make something great even better they screwed part of it up. The screen chips extremely easy, even with protector. Got my S8 Plus at Best Buy, they recomended the screen protector, installed it and said its bullet proof now. 1 drop from about 18 inches. Screen protector shattered and fell off plus chipped the screen. Best buys response. Not our problem.  Would be an excellent phone if not for the home button and extremely brittle screen."
"Amazon" "I like the phone in general its an amazingly dense piece of technology.  One feature in particular I was looking for was barometric altimeter and that works well in this phone.  Ride with GPS app can keep accurate topography on my rides.  I have no interest in adopting another voice assistant in my life though, so the bixby stuff is kind of annoying.  I removed the button actuator from my case because it was being pressed when I took the phone from my pocket or just whenever I picked it up to do something else.  The bicycle mount that I use with it also would press that button.  The moto X touch free voice assistant is superior to the button.I'm not sure that the curved screen adds real utility for me.  its cool but I  think I'd prefer the phone to be flat so that a simple glass protector can be used even if that makes the phone a couple of mm wider.The VR viewer device works really nice with this phone and its hi res screen, and the battery life is considerably better than what I was used to with MotoX phones.  Although the curved screen is kinda cool, it makes using a conventional glass protective cover impossible, and I have now shattered my phone after 4 weeks and this is a really expensive screen to fix.  I'm having a little buyers remorse right now.  Turns out that since I am inside the 90 day warranty, samsung will repair it for about $206 wihich is cheaper than buying a kit on Ebay.  Packing it up to send away for that tomorrow.  5 - 7 business day estimated turn around.  The S8 Active is interesting but more than 2X the price.  Given my usage profile, bulkier and more durable would be an acceptable trade off.Update on the repair:  it went smooth, I was billed as expected and got the phone back in a few days.  THEN I drove off from home with the phone on the roof one day and a neighbor returned it to me in tact.  Just a tiny scratch on one corner of the front glass.Full disclosure, I did drop this phone several times before the killer drop which was a stupid situation where I was holding it over my head to get wifi signal over a barrier..  Given that it is front and back glass, its not as fragile as you might think.  Still, its glass, so dropping it on a rock doesn't end well and the direct bonded OLED + touch + 3D glass assembly is not cheap to replace when it happens."
"Amazon" "Excellent hardware but the Samsung software could have been written better by a sophomore computer science major.The Samsung Bloatware should be uninstallable by the end user. This is my first Samsung phone and probably my last. I bought two because after being an Android purist with Nexus and HTC devices, I figured I would give them a try. I am really disappointed with the Galaxy Software and store. I love Google photos but the camera app keeps forcing the Samsung app on me. I gave it a two star for the software and lack of ability to uninstall most of it. You can disable some apps but they are usually back at reboot. Even with all of my Google app store credits from survey rewards, this will probably push me over the edge to go to iPhone. Samsung, please get your crap together and fix this software abomination."
"Amazon" "Hardware is top notch. The phone is impressively powerful and the beautiful screen makes using it a joy. Music fans will love the SD card support and 3.5mm jack. (Yes, it's still able to store your old massive collection of MP3s AND you can enjoy it with your expensive wired headphones!)Battery lasts the day (unless you're in a cell deadspot) and will get you through the night if you do a rapid top up around noon.The unit is mostly waterproof and will survive in the rain or shower (both tested) but it won't be much use under water and probably won't survive anything much deeper than a bathtub.Software might not be to everyone's liking but it's the usual Android system underneath so you can change it however you like.Only real downside is that it's so pleasant to use I don't use my expensive PC much anymore."
"Amazon" "Definitely a noticeable improvement in speed from the S7; it seems snappier. Losing the physical home key and moving the fingerprint sensor to the back near the camera lens was a little annoying at first, but I got used to it fairly quickly. Even though the physical home key is gone, there is still a satisfying tactile \"click\" for feedback if you press down on the location of the home key. You also can lightly touch the home key and it will respond, like the back and menu keys.The size is nice. The screen is narrow enough that I can reach across the entire screen with my smaller hands, and it is tall/long enough to allow more of a webpage to be read on the screen at one time.Bixby seems like another S voice knockoff that doesn't quite do things as well as Google Voice. There are some youtube videos showing cool tricks you can do with Bixby that can't be done with the other voice apps, but they seem like tricks rather than useful tools. I ended up disabling Bixby, and there are some low-cost apps available to help you do that. The placement of the Bixby button so close to the volume buttons actually ends up with a lot of accidental Bixby pop-ups when you are trying to adjust the volume.The camera is awesome. It starts up quickly and the autofocus is fast. There is plenty of on-board memory for photos and video. One somewhat hidden feature in the Edge is the Animation portion of the Smart Select. You can select an area of the screen while a video is playing and create a GIF. Perfect for making a reaction GIF."
"Amazon" "Pretty good looking and impressive phone. I definitely like it much better than the iPhone 6 that I had. I've had it for 2 1/2 months and so far so good. But Samsung is notorious for their phones doing good for the first 6 months and then crapping out because of their software updates. We'll see. I did go for the Sprint 12 month Forever Galaxy Plan so I don't have to wait every two years to upgrade.The interface is much more intuitive than the iPhone 6. Gorgeous 5.8\" edge to edge Infinity screen. I like how you can crop the screen on YouTube videos. They do need to patch the software to allow users to keep that feature on at all times. Annoying not having that option. Great speakerphone. Loud and clear!Overall, probably the best smartphone on the market right now. As of this post, Apple just announced their new iPhone X. I remember when Samsung was playing catch-up with Apple, now it's the opposite. The iPhone X seems like a copy of the GS8. Front and back glass. 5.8\" curved screen. Probably the same 18.5 by 9.0 ratio screen as well. I don't think most people care for those fat and wide phones, I know I don't. The GS8 is narrow and comfortable in your hand, still sporting a huge screen size for a smartphone.I was watching Fox News when the iPhone X was announced and these people, who by the way all seem to be on the Apple bandwagon, were cheerfully saying and bragging about the X's face recognition, like this was some new technology. The GS8 already has that going back to the Note 7, as well as having iris scanning which the X doesn't have.Did anyone see that jerk CEO Tim Cook brag about the X's feature of their interactive emoticons, using a pile of crap with a funny face? What class! Apple can keep their NSA iPhone X! I know I know, we have the same problem with Google Android phones as well. Oh well, what can we do? I need my smartphone for work. :-("
"Amazon" "Wife recently purchased thru ATT authorized store. She loved the look and feel of the 8+ and at first, it worked great. However, within a few days it stopped working, displaying no network available error code on screen. Problem is, we were at home and my phone, an older Samsung S4 Active, also with ATT was working so there definitely was ATT network service available. Turned the phone on and off a few times, still no signal. Finally, using my phone, called ATT customer service. Forty five mins later with numerous instructions from ATT Agt, using my phone, finally managed to get her phone up and running with Agt stating he had found an error on the part of the store sales clerks initial registration process. Ok, fine. Fast forward 3-4 days later, same problem + phone was shutting itself off for no reason. Back to customer service using her phone this time. It would not allow her to make any outside phone calls or text messages, giving same no network available error code, yet it would allow her to dial customer service using 611, however. Another long conversation with ATT phone rep again who, this time suggested taking phone back to store and have the sim card replaced. Phone was now 16 days old since purchase. Did exactly that and store clerk changed out sim card. Still didn't work. Tried 2nd sim card on same visit and it didn't work either.  Store clerk then erased electronic serial number in their system, re-typed same ser # back in, reinserted 2nd sim card, rebooted phone and it finally worked but only for about 4 days before same problem occurred again. Problem is, she had to go out of town to a funeral and needed a dependable phone. She was so frustrated by now, she had ATT store switch sim card back over to her old iphone 5, which at least had always been dependable, if not very exciting. Thus she was safe on the trip, at least as far as having a phone she could count on again. When she returned home from funeral a few days later, she immediately called ATT customer service, once again explaining her problem. Another 30 min conversation and they now wanted to send her a refurbished phone replacement for a phone she was paying a new phone charge for, not a refurb price. She refused the refurb and the ATT rep finally told her he was making note in file, recommending the selling ATT store take it back. She also called Samsung directly and their rep told her to take it back to store and have them do a factory reset before sending it in to Samsung for warranty repair. Samsung rep was sure that would more than likely fix the problem. So she took the S8+ phone back to ATT store where she bought it, demanding a new phone, since they couldn't seem to fix it. They refused and in stead, sent her sixty miles down the road to an Atlanta Corporate ATT store, the Mgr of the selling store stating he was sure the Corporate store would replace it, what with the ATT phone rep recommending same. Corporate store mgr. was indignant, rude and emphatically refused, stating the selling store should replace it. By now, after several ATT dog and pony shows, failure on their part to do the right thing, my wife had had enough, drove sixty miles back to selling store, dumped the non working S8+ phone as well as the Samsung 8in Tablet they had also talked her into buying with the S8+, demanded a refund for all and a receipt for the returned equipment. ATT store clerk didn't have the authority to do an immediate credit, stating she would have to get the owner to do it over the next few days. Seven days go by with no credit on her acct so she now drives back to store, talks with the clerk again, who immediately credits her acct and credit card for all eqpt. Store clerk admits that this was 3rd Samsung S8+ returned within the last week for similar problems. Meanwhile, a few days later a Samsung factory rep comes by this ATT authorized store, poo poo's the apparent S8+'s problems, stating that it was just probably a bad batch of S8 phones, with no other explanation. Well, now my wife feels pretty much snake bit by Samsung and ATT over this uncalled for ordeal and is in all probability going to change to Verizon or some other carrier and I am sure, by now you have surmised she will not be purchasing a Samsung anything. She's too scared of them and what appears to be a lack of current quality control on Samsung's part compared to their good reputation in the past. Having been an ATT customer for more than ten yrs, she was very surprised and disappointed to learn of ATT's apathy and argumentative nature when failing to back up their phone with proper service after the sale. Additionally, I have been an ATT cell phone customer on my line since 1989(formerly BellSouth) and we are long time Direct TV customers. After seeing how she was treated I am also considering looking elsewhere for a different carrier and equipment, after continuously being their customer for over 28 yrs. Any company and any carrier can have problems. It's how they handle those problems that either insures brand loyalty or causes you to look elsewhere. All they had to do was to do the right thing to start with and give her a new phone that worked. Having refused to do that, what can we possibly expect from them in the future. We are currently paying almost $300.00 a month to ATT for our phone and Direct TV service. Even that did not motivate them to replace the phone, a phone which at the time was less than a month old. We sincerely hope your experience with both ATT and the Samsung S8+ phone is a better one than hers was. My phone is overdue for an upgrade but living thru her experience causes me great pause in considering any new Samsung product, inspite of fact that I have had my S4 Active for several yrs with no problems. I have never looked at another cell phone network provider in all my yrs of ATT service but I now feel compelled to at least see what they can provide."
"Amazon" "I have had this phone for several months now.This phone has great specs and does not fail in that regard. It also contains many of the features expected of flagship phones such as waterproofing and wireless charging.With that said, I had 3 concerns when initially purchasing this phone after coming from a Nexus 6P.1. Phone updates, including upgrades to new versions of Android.2. Non-stock experience, including many Samsung apps already installed.3. Single bottom firing speaker.With that said, the first issue is still a concern. Updates are slow, especially considering that my previous phone is already on the latest version of Android. This is a huge disappointment and will likely prevent me from purchasing another Samsung phone again.The second issue has been less of a concern for me. Many of the Samsung apps add additional functionality that is not found in stock Android. They are very usable and are worth giving a try.The third issue is still and issue, but some people have been able to enable stereo functionality, but will require rooting the phone. The speaker is loud, but stereo audio sounds much better."
"Amazon" "I guess the phone would be a lot better if I could actually hear the person with whom I was speaking. VERY UNHAPPY!!!"
"Amazon" "This phone is clearly new and IS unlocked.Seller shipped unit right away.the factory box had a nice presentation with phone all the cables/fobs/cords present.I have been using this phone for 3 days now and it is working out perfect.To ge my phone on Straight Talk  I went to their website and chatted with the rep.They sent me a sim card called:  \"Verizon Compatible\" Product Id \"TF256PSIMV9TD\"..When it arrived I chatted with rep again -but probably didn't need to do so -.They had me use their website and fill out the activation panels.Basically giving the system the phones MEID the  sim's serial and the money for 1 month service.With that task done, I inserted Sim card into phone and booted it up.I was making calls, and sending texts (both sms and mms) without any issues or hassle."
"Amazon" "I have had this phone for about 5 months now. Now I have owned the S4, Note 4 and now the S8. Samsung is notorious for lag after some months of use. As a previous Samsung phone owner I took some steps to try and mitigate any lag as best I could. I install AVG Cleaner and consistently let it run to clean my device of any unnecessary junk. I reboot it at least once a week! I clear it's ram and delete any background memory hogs that might slow it down. Despite this it has managed to lock up on me at least twice in the 5 months that I can remember and self reboot. There is still some latency but overall it has been pretty responsive. Given the option to purchase it again now that I have had it for 5 months I can't say I would have made another choice. After 5 months it's still a solid phone and in my opinion one of the best phones available as of writing this review.  When I was looking for a new phone to buy 5 months ago I was seriously considering leaving the Samsung line, I was fed up with their notorious lag and wanted something more stable. On the day I decided to buy the phone Samsung had the best deal out. I am glad I waited a while and didn't buy it as soon as it hit the shelves. The price dropped and it came with two free gifts!Verdict... Great phone! Not perfect!  but... Just Great!"
"Amazon" "I waited until recently to purchase the S8+ as my original intention was to get the Note 8 upon its release (after waiting a year after the aborted Note 7). However, all things considered it was difficult to justify the price of the new Note at almost $1,000 whereas the S8+ through Amazon was markedly cheaper.So, the decision was made and I am very happy with the phone as I was in desperate need of an upgrade from my S4 model. I got the S8+ as I was keen to have a larger screen and this screen does the job - large enough to watch videos etc but not so big that it feels awkward.  I haven't spent much time using the camera yet but it is certainly better than my old phone but not sure if it stacks up against my wife's iPhone.I am into the Android ecosystem and the phone worked seamlessly with my Gear watch out of the box.All told, I believe this phone is still state of the art and represents good value for money. I am not sure how much further mobile device manufacturers can go with new models at the $1,000 level but, IMHO, it makes sense to wait a while and purchase a slightly dated phone at a slightly discounted price as you still get lots of bang for your mobile buck!"
"Amazon" "This is one of the coolest cells ever. I had no problem activating.  I read many reviews before buying it and was all prepared to go through the drama everyone said with activating.  First I connected to my WiFi and transferred everything. Which was simple. The phone walked me through connecting the sub and my old droid. The transfer took 1hr 17m. Then I removed my sim card insert it. The phone detected it was a Verizon SIM and completed update. I was able to make a call immediately. The phone walks you through every feature and it is so simple. Don't believe all the negative reviews. This phone is worth it."
"Amazon" "**CAVEAT EMPTOR** My phone and phone box were labelled with the wrong MEID number. When I called Sprint to activate, they told me it wasn't unlocked, so you can imagine my frustration. I finally figured out that if you dial *#06#, it will show you your phone's serial number, MEID #, and IMEI#, which turned out was different than what was on the box or the back of the phone. When I then called Sprint to activate with the actual number and my Sprint SIM card, and everything worked out fine.As to the phone itself, it's great. The screen is nice and large, responsive, good speakers, I like the water resistant design, and the swag is great (comes with the charger w/ USB cable, a transfer USB set to transfer info from your old Samsung phone, and a set of headphones. One of the best things about this phone is that it has NONE of the bloatware that comes with Sprint phones that can't be disabled or turned off.Overally, outside of the hassle, this is a great deal on a great phone."
"Amazon" "I was skeptical at first when switching from Apple IPhone 7 to the Galaxy 8 after using Apple products for a long time.  Well after using it for a few weeks its going back for an IPhone 8.  Most of the basic features were ok and worked fairly well but had tons of app crashing than with Apple.  The main thing I hated here was you could never fully disable Google data raping.  My phones battery was literally draining due to all the back ground app data sharing with google and if you disable it it's still turned on it 50 other places it 50 different ways.  The display, ease of use, quality and value for money pales next to the IPhone.  if Android was not made by Google it might be a better mobile OS.  The software spends so much time data mining it lags the rest of the experience.  The phone is also cheaply built for such a priming price not to mention its lacklustre battery life even with battery saver compared to iPhone 8 or X."
"Amazon" "Works great. Only problem I ran into was not knowing that this phone uses a nano sim instead of a micro sim, so I had to convert my sim card to the smaller size. I cut it down with scissors and it did the job. If you don't feel confident in your cutting abilities, you can go to a cell phone shop and ask them to cut it down for you. Phone is fast and was easy to set up. Works well with T-mobile."
"Amazon" "I had this phone for about 2 weeks, but I ended up returning it. The camera was really great and took quality photos. I also like the overall design and feel the phone felt very premium. But ultimately I didn't enjoy the Samsung skin over Android, and the software felt jittery compared to my previous phone which was the OnePlus 3. Additionally the placement of the fingerprint sensor was very annoying to me as a left handed person who holds their phone and their left hand of majority of the time. It was just too hard to reach and inconvenient to use."
"Amazon" "Overall pretty nice phone. Being water resistant is a major plus, and the fact that the touch screen still mostly works while wet is amazing. It kind of stutters and lags a tiny bit which was disappointing. Battery life is hit or miss. Sometimes it lasts 2 days, and sometimes less than 1. Obviously that should be my fault for using apps that drain the battery but I can't figure out why it happens. I'm not a huge fan of the wrap around screen and it makes me really paranoid since almost no cases actually protect the sides. It could be cool technology when they do a 360 degree wrap around screen that covers the back as well, but in its current state I don't really get the point. It does look pretty though (is that the only point...?). Glare is kind of an issue. Bixby is completely awful and I can't believe Samsung locked out the button so people can't reprogram it to do something useful. I don't get why they're competing with Google on that front, and also don't understand why they're competing in the cloud storage market. Another wtf decision is why they include an awesome AMOLED screen but don't take advantage of the power saving features unless you install third party black themes.Major concern: Samsung Premium Care will not cover phones purchased from Amazon, but they will still accept your money. Super scummy move in my opinion. There was no mention of it until I asked a rep (and good thing I did).Despite my many complaints about Samsung's strange decision making, the hardware is pretty good and the stock OS works well with some tweaks."
"Amazon" "Phone is cool, can definitly do a lot with it. For once I actually found some of the pre-installed apps to be usefull. Disapointed in the battery life, not nearly as good as all the hype."
"Amazon" "I purchased my Galaxy S8 from the Samsung site only because they gave me $200 for my old phone (Galaxy S5). I was hesitant at first, given some of the negative reviews here and also elsewhere on the web. I have now owned the phone for over a month, here are my impressions.1. Red screen: This was one of my main concerns, since many people seem to have received phones with red screens. The phone does have a setting that is called \"blue light filter\", which I find awesome because it tends to protect your eyes from the damage these screens cause especially when used in the dark. With this setting turned on, the colors do tend to look reddish at first, but you quickly get used to it. Otherwise, you can turn it off and the colors of the screen are simply amazing. So I had absolutely no issues here. The screen resolution and size are exceptional.2. Fingerprint scanner: It's on the back of the phone, right next to the camera. At first, I'll admit it was a bit inconvenient, since I had some trouble putting my finger on the scanner rather than the camera. However, the minute I got a case for the phone, this stopped being an issue, since the case border is useful as a guide to put my finger in the right spot. At this point, the scanner is great, it easily recognizes the fingers I have registered and is many times better and faster than the one I had in my prior phone. I am 100% used to it now and even look for the scanner in the back whenever I hold a different phone. So again, no issues here, even if there are a ton of reviews saying that people can never ever get used to it. I actually like the location of the scanner now.3. Size: I had a Galaxy S5, which had a 5.1\" screen. This one has a 5.8\" screen and feels much better. The S8 feels long at first but the dimensions \"make sense\" and you quickly get used to it. There's even an advantage here: I normally carry my phone in my front pants pocket and since the S8 a bit longer I can grab it more easily than I did the S5. I have found the S8 much more comfortable than the S8+ both to carry and to hold, and I haven't missed the extra half inch that the S8+ has.4. Hardware and performance: This is a top-of-the-line phone and I have had absolutely no issues with lag, freezing, quality, or anything I can think of. Videos look amazing, the camera and the camera software are quite more advanced than I am as a user, the sound from the speaker is missing nothing, and the sensors (iris, heartbeat, light, focus and so on) all work perfectly. The phone also comes standard with AKG headphones and they are by far the best I've had, both in sound quality and in the materials used, I feel like they will last for a long time. I also had a problem at first with things like the edge bar getting in the way whenever I was playing a game, but it was a user error: the phone comes with game mode, which easily and quickly hides the edge bar while in a game, so it doesn't get in the way, and the minute you leave the game the edge bar is back on its own. I bought the phone in Coral Blue and the phone color is very attractive.5. Some things I do not like (note: all these things are minor issues for me, that's why I gave the phone 5 stars):5A) Sometimes I don't get notification sounds if, for example, I receive a message after several hours of not receiving one (in the mornings, for example). I just notice that the notification is there all of a sudden. I have tested this and it in fact happes with several apps. I'm sure this will have an easy fix with a software update, but for now I cannot trust notification sounds 100%. Note: this is only true of the sound, the notifications do appear correctly all the time.5B) Like I said before, the headphones are absolutely great. However, they have a quite sturdy and long cover for the jack, and using the phone in landscape mode with the headphones connected is a bit uncomfortable since the cover gets in the way quite a bit. This is inconvenient but by no means a huge issue.5C) Bixby is still very limited, but the phone comes with Google Assistant, which I have found even better than Siri at times. I would just prefer that the physical Bixby button could be configured to use with Google Assistant. It's also a minor issue, since I can always press and hold the home button and get Google Assistant just as easily.5D) There are some web pages where, if you're watching a video in landscape mode and then turn to portrait, the video will not resize. This can be solved by hitting the back button but it's inconvenient. Note: I found that this is true also for the iPhone 8 that my buddy has. Also note: this happens only in *some* pages, most of them work fine.5E) I was surprised at first to learn that there were no tempered glass screen protectors at the Samsung store for this phone. Then it made more sense, since the screen shape does not allow for a good protector. I have bought a couple of relatively inexpensive ones but they don't quite fit the phone or get loose very quickly. I would recommend that you save your money and don't buy any of those off-brand screen protectors for this phone, they won't work. I would prefer to have a screen protector for this phone but I can't have one, unless it's the plastic one Samsung sells.6. In summary: The phone has an extremely attractive design and mine gets noticed quite a bit, so socially it's great. It's also an impressive piece of hardware, so when I'm alone I also enjoy it quite a bit. I have been told that my voice sounds clearer to the other person when I'm in a call since I have had this phone; I can also say that I can hear the other person much more clearly in this phone. The camera is outstanding, the sound and video quality are impressive, and the phone itself is very comfortable to use. Also, I came from a Galaxy S5 and the transfer of data and settings from that phone to the S8 was very quick and easy, and I was impressed at how much this felt like it was my own phone right from the beginning. I would definitely recommend this phone above any others in the market right now."
"Amazon" "Oh yeah! Few things I have emotional response to when pleased, but this phone, I love him! The wrap around edge beautiful. Hi def screen. Options in depth.I'm getting to like Bixby too. It's helping open controller I can't find, look up things on the web, dial, message, calculate, set timer, define. Still exploring that feature.Fingerprint unlocks quickly. The complaints about location next to camera, I guess I got used to it faster than the average monkey! Since I use the phone in a holder in the car, I added a 3rd print, for when I reach over the phone in the holder, right index finger upside down.Iris recognition, cumbersome.  But when fingers are wet or in gloves, print reader fails. So iris scanner helps.Using for music and internet radio at the gym with belt holder and Bluetooth earphones. Nice custom sound setting for the headset, rich!Way way better than my S5.Like the feature that if stolen and they reset the phone, it will not work without my unlock info! So don't even Try to steal it!"
"Amazon" "This phone is absolutely beautiful to hold and it has a sleek, 'new-car' feeling!Over all the functionality is similarly comparable across the Galaxy phones (4/7edge) with exception to few obvious changes (upgrades?) to the phone.  In the quest for the slick, they opted to take away the 'Home' button, which my fingers - as well as other iPhone/Galaxy users - have gotten subconsciously programmed to press, only to find that there are no buttons. I would need to 'swipe up' from the bottom of the screen and a virtual 'Home’ button, 'back' function and 'multi-window' interface becomes accessible.This phone has a Samsung Note8-esque interface (not to mention, the screen size difference between those two is just 0.1 inch!). So outside of the Stylus, S8+ promises to be just as versatile in its use!  One other function they did away with - because of the ‘Home’ button change - I have to use the Volume down+Power button to take a screenshot.  Using my thumb+middle finger to squeeze a shot may get some getting used to!The 3500mAh Battery holds well through the day (I use it heavily and I only seem to be down to about 35% by dinner time) and the only thing that seems to 'overheat' the product and/or shorten the battery life is when I am using it with VR.When I first had the Samsung S4, I was able to capture image of a beautiful low-light sunset (for which I was selected winner for a photography submission) and ever since then I’ve been HOOKED!  I took a photo of another sunset! This one was taken without any special filter and yet it beautifully captures the layers of the fading colors - S8+ exceeds it’s low-light capabilities of it's predecessors!  In addition, there are some new photo functions (swipe left in ‘Camera’). I love that as an inner (or Yelp) ‘Foodies’, I have my very own food filter to snap as many lunch or dinners as I pleased!  Use the 'Pro' function and I am Wow'd with the filter package it comes with!Getting an unlocked phone will give me the freedom to choose mobile network not just in the US but Internationally - which is great, as an international photographer to travel with and it sure beats carrying around multi handsets!  As an unlocked phone, this Samsung S8+ has both CDMA and GSM capabilities.  I went with a CDMA network, and the company blocked my ‘Talk and Surf’ function. On the bright side, CDMA does seem to preserve the battery life better so it’s a toss up!As the saying goes, ya either will Love it or Hate it, like Kimchee.  Take it from a diehard Macgirl that switched out of the iPhone to a Samsung.  It was worth it and haven’t gone back!   "
"Amazon" "I recently traded in my galaxy S6 for this galaxy S8+. I am just going to say the 6 was way better!! The talk-to-text feature is horrible, the preemptive text is a joke - on the rare occasion it actually gets the words right AND spelled correctly, it capitalizes all the words it is trying to correct or thinking you may want to say next - even if it is the middle of a sentence!! Then there is Bixby, which, well, just no. It is all bad. Then there is the cutting edge camera in this phone which is really just ok unless you want to zoom in and, no matter, the lightin, you may as well forget it. I definitely miss all the things about my Galaxy S6. Buying this S8+ was a huge mistake. The only good feature on this phone is the size of the screen. I love the Galaxy phones, but this particular model is just a huge fail! I would definitely recommend skipping this model for an earlier one or hopefully the next one that cpmes out will but a lot better. Veey unhappy with this phone."
"Amazon" "Love love love it! I replaced a Samsung J3 from AT&T with this this high end S8. The J3 just didn't have what it takes to operate the WIFI in my new apartment building \"fortress\". The Amazon price for this unlocked S8 cannot be beat - $300 less than anywhere else! As directed by AT&T I only had to insert the Sim card from my J7 and it was good to go instantly! I couldn't be happier with my unlocked S8 at this spectacular Amazon Prime price!"
"Amazon" "Samsung has created a wonderful upgrade to the S7. First of all, the 8+ has an increased screen size with superior clarity. The resolution is by far the best that I've seen on a smartphone. Also, the camera is very easy to maneuver with great quality pictures. There are many options to use to get creative. Next, the internal storage is quite adequate and double the S7's. My favorite feature is the battery life. Prior phones seemed to need charging constantly. The 8+ holds a charge very well and requires minimal charging. Since I am often \"on the go\", this feature is invaluable! Finally, the processor is far superior. I immediately noticed a difference when using the S8+. However, I would be remiss not to mention a couple of points that have been difficult to become accustomed to with this phone. The S8+ does not have a physical Home button - which I miss because I am a creature of habit. Also, I am constantly hitting the Bixby button when I am attempting to reach the volume buttons. The positioning of the buttons has been a bit challenging. With all of the positive upgrades, I would definitely recommend this smartphone."
"Amazon" "I've had this phone for almost two weeks.  Here's is my review on the phone.Battery life is about 12 hours. Takes about 1.5 hr. To chargeThe phone is tough.  I've dropped it twice onto concrete with no breaks or scratchesThe camera is greatSince this is a unlocked phone you won't get some of ATT s extras like video calling.All in all I love this phone"
"Amazon" "A great phone ruined by a dedicated Bixby button that can't be disabled. Bixby is Samsung's attempt to force their Siri-like solution on the world. I hit this button several times a day and everyone around me is forced to listen to this stupid BRRIING sound while I try to kill the app. Other reviewers talk about how easy it is to disable it. You cannot disable it.Again a great phone, but for me no amount of other features can make up for forcing me to deal with Bixby every day."
"Amazon" "Overall it a great phone. But you don't see any performance improvement compared to Snapdragon 820 processor based phones.Always check the seller before placing the order.Pros:Sleek, beautiful phone.Great camera, screen, battery life and call quality.Cons:I am not getting any notification in my fitbit charge 2 even after enabling all available permission for the app / phone factory reset. I think samsung want to promote their Wearables. I can give 5 stars if samsung fix this issue.Full glass body. Handle carefully.Lot of bloatwares with the phone. But you can disable the apps.Awkward position of fingerprint reader."
"Amazon" "I bought at AT&T store at a much higher price; that's a whole 'nuther story!  Pros:  Good camera, fast processor, sufficient memory, sharp display, that's it.  Cons.  It should be said I prematurely retired my perfectly good Samsung Mega (pre-Notes).  So this screen is way to small, small buttons, small type, small icons, small.  The wrap-around edge thing is bogus, just makes it hard to hold without a fat case.  Speaking, tiny thin flimsy and fragile.  The aftermarket is rich with contact screen stick-on guards and robust cases just so you can hold it without accidentally calling Russia, by accident.  Don't buy this stuff in AT&T store either. It'll cost 5x!  Strange charging cord, all my old ones are obsolete.  New Note isn't any better in size either; I liked my old phablet and they just can't be had any more.  You can still get the I-6S+ which comes close.  Really miss my old phone."
"Amazon" "Everything works out for this phone.But if you are looking for carrier features like HD voice quality, video calling and wifi calling, this is not a device for you. NO UNLOCKED phone will support these features. So its a trade off between the carrier bloat ware and the carrier call features.But all in all this is one rock solid phone."
"Amazon" "So I've owned a Pixil for a couple of years and then put it the washing machine.  Oops. I initially bought the S8, having visited a phone store and really liked the display. It's quite vibrant. However, in accustoming myself to the phone I had problems with \"Hi, Bixby\". Bixby is a 2nd AI on the phone designed to work and perform phone tasks. The 1st AI is \"Ok, Google\". One phone, two AI's and I never found out if they talk to each other. There are 10 levels to Hi, Bixby and I never got past level 3. Another problem was the news feed (which will probably not bother others as it did me) but every headline in the news feed was on top of a photo, so I had to process a picture as well as read a headline printed over variable colors. Add to that, instead of the feed being one box over another box it is in a hop-scotch format: one box over two side-by-side boxes over one box over two side-by-side boxes over....So my eyes have to jump all over the place to read a headline. Too much effort was required by me to read a line. The last problem I couldn't get over was the alarm volume. Can't get to the volume slide without setting an alarm to go off. The slide does not show up in the drop down menu for volume control. Nowhere could I find it in settings. And for the two daily alarms I have, lowering the volume doesn't remain low. It always went back to a default level. So I have returned this phone and got another Pixil."
"Amazon" "I have been using apple product for a while and have gotten used to them. I am still getting used to this phone.Pros:It takes better pictures than my Iphone 6.It seems to have a better battery life (for now)You can buy your own additional memory without paying apple.Cons: Be prepared to buy yet another charger cable.You will need to download some of your apps or have to search for a new one.You will have to search for some of your photos, mine got jumbled up. I didn't lose them but I couldn't find them too easily."
"Amazon" "Operating System:  If you’re a Samsung user, or even if you’ve never owned a Samsung in the past, I highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy S8+.  This phone is by far the fastest operating phone that Samsung has ever made. This is the perfect phone for someone that spends a high amount of time on their phone and wants the speed of the phone to be able to keep up.  This phones operating system will not slow down for you, it will be able to handle anything you throw at it.User Interface:  This phone also has very friendly user interface.  You can make it as easy as you want, and on the other hand you can make it very customization with very complex setting that many people enjoy to toy around with.Battery Life:  The battery life on this phones seems to be incredible compared to the other Samsung’s in the past.  Even with being on social media, snapchat, and the browsing the internet for several hours a day, you will usually end the day with above 50% battery life.  There are many settings that you can toy around with to make the battery better.  One thing you are able to shut off to improve your battery life is the “always on display”, this is a feature that always shows what time it is, which uses unnecessary battery life.Water Resistant:  This is a great feature to have on a phone.  You never phone when you will accidentally drop your phone in the toilet, river, or other wet places.  You will enjoy the water resistant feature of your phone when you are able to fetch it out before there is water damage done to your phone.Fast Charging:  You will want to get this phone with the fast charger if possible.  Everyone hates waiting for their phone to charge, when you really need to use.  With this charger your phone will be charged in no time.Bixby:  The Bixby button on this phone is a feature where you tell it commands and it’s supposed to perform whatever task you tell it to do within the phone.  This is a nice feature for when you would be driving or really anything that needs to be hand free.  The one negative thing about this is that the button for it is directly below the volume buttons, so it often gets bumped on accident and goes off."
"Amazon" "These manufacturers are charging way too much money for cell phones these days. A man is supposed to spend 3 months salary on an Engagement ring to ask his lady to marry him, not 3 months salary on a phone.Joking aside I've been an android user since the beginning of the smart phone era. Before this S8 I had an S5 and it was a very nice transition.This phone works and works well. I love that it's water proof and when it gets dirty I  just hold it on under running water and scrub if with hand soap. The naked phone is a bit slippery so I highly recommend the otter box defender case.I bought this phone on sale during Prime Day which gave a nice $200 discount plus they threw in a few free toys. The package included the wireless charging pad which I use everyday but would never pay extra for. It's really not necessary. And it came with the VR goggles which I still haven't taken out of the box. I know the goggles need the naked phone and I keep my phone in the otter box case so I'll never use the goggles. If it was an option I honestly would have preferred a heavier discount on the phone and they could have kept the wireless pad and goggles."
"Amazon" "Pros:* Battery life is great.  I got a full day off of one charge with regular use.* Screen is bright and vibrant* Camera is greatCons:* Curved edges to the phone make it slippery and slightly distort the image.  They make the phone pretty to look at it when it's off but that's no that point.* Fingerprint sensor on the back is hard to reach. Plus, it's right next to the camera lens so you smudge up the lens trying to read your finger.* Comes bundled with Samung's Bixby AI assistant that you can't uninstall.  It's triggered off of a button on the side that is only used for Bixby.Moved to this from a Note 4 and I miss my old Note.  It was easier to hold and non-rounded edges gave it more usable screen space."
"Amazon" "I bought my phone new and got charged for it but I received it used. There is no warranty information inside as well."
"Amazon" "Will not support wifi calling (or other Advanced Calling features) on Verizon.  I was able to install the Verizon sim and get the phone working without problems but features are missing, with WiFi calling being a big one. Verizon says they are aware of this with Samsung S8 unlocked phones and there is nothing they can do as all features are enabled on their end.  Samsung has not responded to my queries so they don't get any points for customer service.Other things to be aware of: It really is slippery so you need a case, but be aware that the case really won't protect the phone screen because it will be designed not to cover the infinity edges.  It really is too big for your pockets.  Cut a piece of foam board the size of the device and carry it around with you for a few days.Other than the missing features, this phone seems to work fine.  I would not buy it again but if you must, get one from your communications carrier, not an unlocked version."
"Amazon" "This is the best phone out there and why would you carry an $800 phone in your pocket?? Especially without a glass screen protector?? That's a bad call and there are products out there that strengthen the glass. Why people choose to put them in there pocket is beyond me and I want to protect my big investment. I have an otter box case and screen protector on mine. I work construction and have had no problems with it. So quit complaining and protect your 800 buck phone. Duhhh"
"Amazon" "Phone works great but extremely disappointed in the design.  In this case front glass replacement.  Doesn't matter if you have insurance or not it's gonna cost you 150 to 300 dollars.  I consider this a design flaw but Samsung is pleading otherwise.I dropped my phone only six to eight inches off the ground and cracked the front screen.  I've had other phones like the note 3 and 5 and were dropped from higher places and screen fine.  I'm just fortunate enough to have my touch screen still working for now.I'd rate this phone better if it was designed to easily replace the screen."
"Amazon" "YES!!! It works on Verizon wireless. I took out the sim chip out of my working s6 and plugged it into the s8 and it just worked!!! Nothing else needed, no activation needed.This is an early review.. Ill append as I fiddle around with the phone.Con:  NO IR blaster (so no controlling infrared devices like a TV or Cable box unless theyre \"smart\" devices on the same network) so you cant use it as a universal remote control like I did with the S5 and S6"
"Amazon" "If you want a gorgeous device with a great camera and amazing specs look no further. When I got the S8 I was a little worried about it being used. To my surprise it was absolutely perfect. I had a couple concerns and after emailing the seller and they went above and beyond to help. I'm completely satisfied with my purchase."
"Amazon" "The screen is incredible.  One of the best Android phones out there if not the best.  Camera is great in low light situations.  Battery life is good and lasts me the whole day.  Also has a quick charging feature if you use supported Qualcomm quick charge adapters.  Only thing that annoys me is the Bixby feature.  I basically have disabled it and switched over to the Google Assistant.  Default Samsung applications for basic smart phone use are very good and minimalistic.  For example the calendaring, contacts, and messaging apps all support the basic needed functionality well.  Best thing though is the screen when you are watching HighDef video content or viewing your photos.  Really clear when you've got the right content."
"Amazon" "4.5/5 for this phone. I am an iphone user making the switch to android. So far i really like the phone. Very easy to use. Definitely love the storage on this phone. Screen is very pleasing to the eyes. Only critque is the finger scanner. Too small and awkwardly placed in my opinion."
"Amazon" "Relative to what I would have paid if I'd gone full price, I'm happy with the phone overall.I did a side by side comparison of the used device and the brand new device I ordered on my own and with enmployees at the ATT store and none of us could find any imperfections so A+ in that regard.However, after less than two months the speaker is terrible. It sounds like I'm playing whatever I'm listening to (mostly music and podcasts) from the inside of a box. I thought the muffled noise issue might have something to do with water exposure after being near the shower (I know, I know, water resistant does not mean waterproof), so I took some precautionary measures as soon as I noticed the distortion, turned it off, and tossed it in a bag with silica gel overnight. For a phone that's advertised as being resistant to spills, it's kind of a joke that sitting on a shelf outside a shower could spell disaster for its audio output.Additionally, the phone is a lot less durable than one would expect. I still expected the glass screen to be more resistant to scratches."
"Amazon" "Okay. There are lots of negative reviews about this phone but honestly I absolutely LOVE this phone. I used to have an s5 until it got old. I switched to LG for 6 months and I missed my galaxy phone. So I decided to splurge and get myself an s8! That being said... this phone NEEDS A GOOD CASE. I work around concrete floors so I made certain to buy a solid, shock resistant case with protection around the edges. I also got a glass screen protector just out of paranoia. The phone works incredibly well and performs my level of work I need it to do with no problems. :)"
"Amazon" "Awful for photographers. Notice I said photographers and not photography because I'm not referring to the phone camera itself, I'm referring to the phone display. I shoot pictures on both digital and film to share on social media. The camera on the phone is great, not on par with some other flagship offerings, but the ability to shoot raw dng and edit in phone is much appreciated. However, as a photographer who shoot everything from landscape to macros to portraits, I must admit the phone display is absolute garbage. And I knew this coming in as some reveiwers such as MKBHD warned about the warmer and more saturated colors of this phone, particularly the red tones. Here's where the issue lies for me. I shoot a photo of a couple during an engagement session on my digital equipment, throw the picture on my computer with calibrated monitors and color grade to my liking yet maintaining accurate skin tones to the best of my abilities. When I upload the edited images to my phone, the skin color looks like a pumpkin barfed on an magenta crayon. I checked the images on an a few iPhones and LG phones and they look very close to how they did on my calibrated monitor. This poses several problems, 1. people who view my work on Galaxy phones think I suck at photography unless they realize that their display is at fault and 2. When taking raw images on the phone and editing with readily available apps, which is why I picked this phone, the colors I see and believe to be accurate isn't accurate at all! So my workflow would be to take the raw image on the phone, throw on my computer to edit and load back on the phone to share, you see how the workflow is slowed down considering I wanted all that work to be done promptly on the phone? I will admit that for landscape and macro where saturated colors actually enhances the images (depending on personal taste), this is a non issue. I just wish the display wasn't so pumped up like it is. Also I adjusted the display colors to cool it down as much as possible and the skin tones are still awful.The phone itself is top of the line, blazing fast, durable, water proof, detailed display. Nothing more you can ask for in a phone besides more muted reds in the display."
"Amazon" "I'm rating 5 stars to counteract the carrier shills who tell you not to buy this phone. They are wrong. Anybody who tells you not to buy this because of \"updates\" is a fool. The Unlocked phone is literally the best version, because it works everywhere, and you will never be stuck on a carrier with it. You pick this phone, and you can use whichever carrier has the best service in your area. You won't be under contract, you won't have any obligations, and you get the best price. Buy once, cry once, as they say.Not only that, but you get the phone as Samsung intended, with all features (Samsung Cloud, Caller ID, Device Maintenance) intact and zero carrier meddling."
"Amazon" "After I got this phone, I used it less than 10 mins later the screen was froze and didn't response to any actions. I couldn't turn it off. The device keeps on for 4hrs (only thing good is the battery last long time?!) and was super hot the whole time. It finally shouted off after the battery runs out. This is my first purchase Samsung product and VERY DISAPPOINTED!! I don't understand why a new device stop working in the very first day!I contacted to Samsung costumer service and it is horrible horrible horrible. I emailed them several times and NEVER got responds (Their website said they will reply within 24 hrs, never happened!!)"
"Amazon" "I don't usually leave reviews but this phone is stunning. I bought the phone through a third party seller that offered the phone with a bundle of high quality accessories. All for $40 dollars less than the listed Amazon price. I couldn't be happier with my purchase.A warning though like many other reviewers this phone is very delicate put a good case and screen protector on this phone it definitely is not meant to be naked. The water proof design is a life savior as my previous phones had died to h2o, it's nice to know this phone is safe against most situations."
"Amazon" "The phone is fine, but god help you if you have a customer service issue. Absolutely the worst! That's saying something with companies like Comcast in existence, but Samsung takes the cake. They ignore you as long as humanly possible (do not reply at all--let alone in the 24 hours they promise to). If you do manage to get in touch with them, they'll transfer you 4-5 times before telling you the department you need is closed. I pay AT&T $32 a month for this so I'm stuck, but I will NEVER purchase another Samsung product as long as I live and I recommend you don't either--they don't care about theit customers at all."
"Amazon" "I've only had the phone for a few hours, but I can confirm that it CAN be activated on Verizon.  I bought 2 phones, went into my local store to get one of them activated.  The clerk provided a SIM card and got it running in just a few minutes (but be prepared to spend two or three hours reloading your apps and configuring the phone's options).Waited to set up my second phone until my wife got home this evening.  I was planning on doing it myself online, but had a minor issue finding the right numbers on the phone itself (the online tool wasn't accepting the numbers).  I used Verizon's online chat, and the operator had it up and running in just a few minutes.  No problems."
"Amazon" "This was an upgrade from a Nexus 6p. Overall I'm very happy with the Samsung Galaxy S8. I do wish there was a way to easily disable Bixby. It's clunky at best. Personally I prefer Google Assistant.There are several blog posts with how to change Bixby to Google Assistant. If you are as frustrated as I am then I recommend you uninstall Bixby and switch over to the Google Suite of services."
"Amazon" "I bought this phone unlocked from another source. I was a Nexus phone user and was happily into my Nexus 5x usage for 1.5 years and it went into a bootloop (a known issue). I had to have a phone immediately so bought an S8.Pros;- Beautiful design, screen is awesome- I like how Samsung shows battery percent and data up/download in the status bar- Battery life seems pretty good- MicroSD card capabilityCons:- Screen design (curve) means much easier to break/damage, even with a case- Bixby button is easy to hit, a pain. Samsung has prevented owners from remapping it.- Volume buttons above Bixby button, way too high- FINGERPRINT READER location sucks, and shape sucks too. My Nexus had it right - center back, big pad and easy quick recognition- Samsung Touchwiz launcher is better than old days, but still why mess up vanilla Android? Splitscreen mode not as intuitive as vanilla Android. Home screen has much wasted space as second row of icons goes well above tray, wasting space. I ended up downloading the Google Launcher and that made a huge difference- Camera is surprisingly not as good as Nexus 5x, especially in low light (this is same camera as in Nexus 6p, and current PixelI called Google and even though my 5x is out of warranty, they are shipping me a refurb 5x free! So I am going to pay the restocking charge and return the Galaxy S8, and wait for the Google Pixel 2. Samsung has the name recognition but IMHO this phone is not as good as people think. Google's service was excellent and I'm happy to continue with them where I always have the latest OS and latest security updates as soon as they come out."
"Amazon" "Best Phone I have ever used or owned!!!! it took a little bit to figure out how to connect with metro pcs but it works beautifully"
"Amazon" "I wanted to write a review about the product because other reviews helped me when deciding on whether or not to get this phone. AllI can say is get this phone. The phone itself is beautiful. It's sleek and fits nicely in your hand. The processor is fast, it's very responsive, and all around a great phone for this price. I've always been an Android user and this phone doesn't disappoint. Most of these reviews are about Bixby and how annoying she is, how the battery isn't as good as other Samsung phones, and the list can go on and on. Regardless of those things, I think it's still an all around great phone, because nothing is perfect. For this price, I would recommend getting this phone! Just remember to keep it protected no matter what! Hope this review helped other skeptical buyers! :)"
"Amazon" "I bought this phone when it was on sale for $625. Great deal, based on other prices. I purchased this after my Galaxy S5 died. Coming from the S5, this is a major upgrade. The phone is beautiful, but due to my tendency to drop phones, I have it in a case. I expected to be annoyed by Bixby (based on other reviews), but I actually like \"her\" so far. She's not Siri, but I think she is better than Google's personal assistant. I like that you can unlock the phone by telling Bixby a voice password and because she learns your voice, she won't respond to another voice. My husband tried to talk to her and she ignored him.Besides Bixby, there are a number of upgrades from the S5. Rather than several pages with apps (you can still do that), there is an edge \"tray\" that you can use to easily access your favorite apps. I strongly recommend watching a youtube video to get to know the phone because it can do a lot. Without it, I wouldn't have known about the edge tray, because it is well hidden. I've only had the phone for less than 24 hours, but I will update the review if my opinion changes."
"Amazon" "This is my very first Smartphone and I love it so far.  Just for calling, texting, checking emails and taking photos, it's terrific, but that's all I have sampled so far. From what I understand from my other, more \"tech-savvy\" smartphone-owing pros, this is great.  Will advise if anything changes after i've had it for more than one month, but I don't foresee that happening.  Just love it. OH- I specifically got an unblocked phone so I could shop around (I'm in Florida). I decided on Verizon, but they were unable to make this phone compatible with their system. Something about CDMA vs. GSM."
"Amazon" "Far too fragile for everyday use. I dropped this from 2-3 feet up (hand at my side), with a case, and the curved glass corner cracked. Samsung of course makes a fortune selling replacement screens, though I'm going to buy another brand phone instead. Durability should be much, much higher at this price point for a device that's taken with you wherever you go. Independent tests confirm poor durability here."
"Amazon" "Awesome phone!  Works great with no issues with Verizon Wireless.  I did have to go in and get a new SIM card however, since my old one was a micro-SIM, this phone uses the smaller nano-SIM card."
"Amazon" "BIXBY IS TERRIBLE! Every time I pull my phone out she says \"there are two ways you can find me.\" There is no way to turn Bixby off, only silence her. This has driven me insane. Also, the screen protectors seem to pop off super easy on this phone. Mine came off the first week. Great camera, typical Samsung Galaxy, upgraded with all the bells and whistles."
"Amazon" "I received the phone with open packaging. There was no seal on the phone and protective thin film on the phone packaging was also missing.It seems like I received the phone returned by someone else."
"Amazon" "Extremely fragile. After only 6 days of use it fell from my hand to the table (about 5 inches) and the screen cracked, part of the screen went green and stopped working. What about the \"gorilla glass\"?? What kind of \"gorilla glass\" can't resist to a 5 inch fall? Samsung has charged me 430 dollars (in Brazil) to Fix the damn thing.DON'T BUY IT!!"
"Amazon" "Received this phone 3 days ago, and finally got the SIM card from VZN.  Apparently, this phone has an issue with NOT being able to send sms texts.  Spent 2 hours in the Verizon store trying to get it sorted out.  2 factory resets, and 2 additional SIM cards - still will not send SMS texts.Besides the no texting problem, the other issues I found in the short time I had this phone is:-The new 'Bixby' feature is a huge disappointment.  Extra side button which is easily hit by holding the phone.Fingerprint reader is in an awkward position on the back of the camera.  Unable to use thumb print unless turning phone around.So, if you're just looking for an expensive phone without the ability to respond to texts, or constantly pulling up Samsung's attempt at AI whenever you pick up the phone - then this one is a winner.  If you're looking to actually use all of your phone's capabilities - then I suggest going elsewhere.I've been with Samsung since the Galaxy S1 days, and this is by far, the WORST phone I have ever encountered (and I even had the Note 7 for a short time).  Returning this POS."
"Amazon" "Good phone. Here are the pros n consPros:Good cameraVibrant screenGreat battery lifeGreat looksCons:Very difficulf to find right tempered glass. As the edge function will not eork well. You end up using samsung flip cover, which hides all the buty.Preloaded apps and bixy button are painful."
"Amazon" "Had a blackberry PRIV with Android that cost me gazzilion and died on me in about a year.As soon as I turned this phone on, immediately noticed incredible difference as to the speed: opening apps, installing, uninstalling, opening and browsing the internet - bam! everything happens just about immediately with this phone, no delays, no \"thinking\" no crashing (so far).One thing that annoys me a bit is really how sophisticated the phone is, like if you put it on a table screen down it will do certain things, face up others, tons of options for how the screen will behave what light what notifications even the movement of the phone itself makes it behave differently, basically I'd have to spend many hours figuring it out that's the only thing but I guess there are bigger problems out there.."
"Amazon" "The best phone ever! !The specs of this phone don't speak out much, but this phone is filled with tons of features, just name the feature. It is thin, perfect looking, brilliant camera. Looks great in our hands. BATTERY My old phone used to consume around 80% of the battery life during the day but this phone has only consumed 35%. Amazing perforce. The new Bixby feature is a great move by Samsung. Google assistant makes the phone even better. The new screen off feature is too good. The edge feature is very usefull at times. Has fingerprint scanner face scanner and iris scanner. The iris scanner, my favorite,  is super fast much better than the iPhone X. The finger print sensor is awkward in position but its super fast too. The screen is mind blowing. Dont hesitate to buy this... Worst every penny"
"Amazon" "I didn't buy my S8+ from Amazon, but I did buy it unlocked. And if you try to activate it with a network under their Bring Your Own Device provisions, you need to ask for an ISIM card. CSIM and USIM type SIM cards will not work."
"Amazon" "I really love this phone. Best phone ever, hands down. Very well made and constructed"
"Amazon" "Okay so to start off Samsung made an incredibly beautiful device however next time they should spend more time working and the hardware functionality.SoftwareMy phone before the Samsung s8 was the nexus 6p.  Needless to say the transition from having no bloat to a bunch of Samsung bloat took awhile to get use to. Touchwiz or tizen is not as bad as it use to be but the part I found most annoying was Samsung's very own so, Bixby.  Samsung even gave Bixby it's own button to access it but I found myself always pressing it on accident and unintentionally. When I would use an ai it would always be Google assistant it seemed more practical than Bixby. Needless to say Bixby is still young and has much to grow but it didn't really leave a lasting impression for me.BatteryThe battery on the s8 was not bad considering it's a quad hd bezleless screen.  When default settings(quad hd resolution mid brightness) were active on the battery I would get around 4 hours of screen on time.  When I changed the setting to full us resolution and low brightness I was able to get through a whole day.  The standby time on this phone is also great. My phone would have around 10% battery life before I went to sleep and when I would wake up it's only be at 8%.CameraUnlike most manufacturers Samsung didn't choose to go dual cameras on this device which wasn't really a bad thing.  This is one of the phones that proves more is not always better(more being more cameras). The back camera does a great job in low light performance and in my opinion still took better photos than the iPhone 7. The selfie camera was adequate it wasn't great in my experience cause Samsung software tends to smooth out the image alot when using the selfie camHardwareThis is the area where I just did not have a good experience with this phone. For starters the fingerprint reader.  I'm not going to complain about the placement but rather how accurate it is.  I had to same the same finger twice and I still can't unlock it on the first try.  I am frequently having to unlock my phone with my password instead cause of how many times it fails to read my fingerprint.  The charging port was another issue I was having. Samsung tends to promote wireless charging for a reason and it's because their charging port is not that great. I use the charger that came in the box and my phone sometimes doesn't even charge or sometimes it doesn't even read that it's a quick charge compatible charger. I tried other chargers but it was even harder to charge.  The other bad part of their hardware is that Bixby button it just isn't that needed and would have been better if the button could be remapped to some other function.DesignOverall the best part of this phone is the design. Samsung s8's design are in a class of their own due to those super thin bezles no one has really been able to match.  The edge display just makes the display experience all the better."
"Amazon" "I have had this phone since the day it came out. I am a poor college student but my phone that I had previously was not powerful enough for my nursing clinical. I waited to review this device because I wanted to run it through nursing clinical before I have it a good review.1). This phone is a very practical size. It has a large enough screen to be pleasant and easy to use buy without being clumsy in hand. The Super Amoled display is great the best on the market simply put.2). Software and Performance: So we all know Samsung has had its software issues in the past. It is just a really heavy and poorly optimized skin. On top of that, still being on 7.0 Nougat and not 7.1.1 or 7.1.2 is kind of frustrating. They are improved versions of Android with much better battery optimizations. As far as Samsung Experience is concerned, this is a huge improvement from previous iterations of Touchwiz. It is much smoother and more lightweight than before and it helps. With that being said it still has stutter issues. Not lag but stutter. No lag meaning there is no delay response when opening apps and such. But it does fail to open some apps smoothly sometimes. The Snapdragon 835 and 4 GB of ram do enough however to power through everything. I have an app on my phone that we use during clinicals. It has an entire library or medical terminology and practices that we need to be able to call upon at a moment's notice. This phone does not fail me. I also game frequently and this device blows through it.3). Camera: People and reviewers have complained that the camera is just not improved enough. Hmm...thats funny because a lot of those same reviewers have also said it is still one of the top 3 cameras on the market. It is very reliable and takes some incredible pictures. I use it a lot in class for some blackboard notes. Clear as day even in dark conditions. Just a great great camera overall.4)Battery: This has been a very controversial aspect of this phone. Some people have had good battery life, and some have had not so good battery life. I personally get good battery life but not stellar. I keep the phone on 1440p resolution because that is what I paid for, and I get about 4 1/2 hours of battery life. I wake up at 6:30 every morning and my phone lasts me tulle about 11 at night with about 20% to spare. I have had and seen better but the battery has been able to at least keep it's charge very well despite being several months old now.5). Overall: This device is a solid overall package. I think it nails most things but has a few of its querks. A lot of people will be wondering if the Galaxy S8 should be dumped for the Not 8. I would say no. I would personally wait for the S9 or in my case the Note 9. This phone is basically a smaller Note 8 with a single rear camera and no S pen. Unless you have money burning a hole in your pocket the Note has nothing outrageous to offer in comparison."
"Amazon" "I am very pleased with this phone.  Amazon shipped it promptly and it was delivered on time.  Moving from an S5 to an S8+ was so easy.  The screen on this phone is amazing.  You get that amazing screen without the phone feeling bulky.  It is so thin and feels great in your hand.  The battery life is incredible and the quick charge feature is great.  Getting a screen protector on the phone was a bit different with the infinity screen, but well worth the extra effort to protect the screen.  There are a variety of cases available."
"Amazon" "The glass on my phone broke while it was in a case in my pocket. You can't find repairs at a reasonable price anywhere making the phone effectively a paper weight. I will not purchase another device from Samsung again."
"Amazon" "Pros:- gorgeous display ( seriously you will fall in love with this bezeless beauty)- So many helpful and useful features that I never knew I wanted/needed- Insane battery life- Unlimited customization options- More storage than you'll ever need, plus sd slot in case you somehow need more- The list goes on and onCons: (Small things but worth noting)- Dedicated \"Bixby\" button is annoying if accidentally pressed- Slick (can be fixed with skin or case)- Fingerprint sensor is in kind of a weird spot (especially for left-handed users)All in all every second of using this phone had been an absolute pleasure!"
"Amazon" "Such a great phone! After doing months of research, I wasn't sure which phone to choose. Pixel 2, LG V30, S8 or even iPhone.  I finally decided the S8 has most everything I wanted.  Wireless charging, great camera, decent battery and a perfect screen!After a month, I am so happy with my decision!  Wonderful phone, perfect!"
"Amazon" "I purchased this as a surprise for my Wife as an upgrade to her existing S4. She was so surprised and happy when it was delivered. She has hardly When Wife is happy ... we're ALL happy!"
"Amazon" "Let me start by saying that i owned almost all the Samsung Galaxy phones starting from s2, and i am a big Samsung fan. However the recent crop of Galaxy phones is left to be desired when it comes to the form factor and the screen. The biggest issue is with the AMOLED screen, which is oversaturated and suffers from back light shimmer especially around text. It suffers from poor white balance and contrast, as well as from Blu light bleeding around the curved edges. The font is noticably less sharp than on Apple's retina displays, and whites are almost gray... Very bad rendition of AMOLED technology, IMHO...Second biggest problem with the latest Galaxy lineup is the  elongated form factor which is very hard to use with one hand, as well as view content in landscape mode. Not all applications support the ultra wide screen format, and the contents looks odd in a very short but wide viewing area...Also not insignificant the fact that the phone is literally very slick, and can easily slip out ones hands. The galaxy back cover of the case feels fragile, and the phone simply requires a case to have any semblance of durability. It is literally superslick and fragile... Huge design problem...and this is not to mention that especially in black it is a fingerprint magnet...It is a shame, sine the phone is really a good performer and has a good battery life...  and I really love Samsung's latest rendition of it's TouchWiz Android experience...I bought this phone unlocked from BestBuy thinking I would fall in love with it, but unfortunately I had to return it on the third day at a penalty. I do not recommend this phone, especially at its current high price point..."
"Amazon" "So this is the first time I have actually bought a flagship device from Samsung all my previous ones were of the other variety however I can say this is hands down the best device I've had to date.Pros:1. The price, considering the device usually goes for 700-800 USD getting in at 574.99 is a very good deal, this was the factor that made me get it over an iPhone.2. The camera and video quality is AWESOME. I've never had pics looking this great.3. Its super fast like the boot up was effortless and switching between apps is a breeze.4. Since all my previous devices were 1GB RAM and 8 GB memory having one now that is 4GB RAM and 64GB memory its an eye opener plus having expandable storage with an SD card just won my heart.5. Battery life is great. I can go one day without charging with moderate to high usage which is good.6. The speakers are loud AF like I was shocked when listening to Youtube videos.Cons:1. The finger print scanner, this should be a common cry at the moment but its is placed at possibly the most inconvenient place for a finger print scanner.2. The phone is made entirely of glass which for me is a concern cause i'm a klutz so I recommend getting a good case and a Tempered Glass screen protector.FYI: THIS PHONE IS UNLOCKED. It can be used with ANY carrier. I am using it in Jamaica right now and it works perfectly fine.I would recommend this phone to anyone because it has good internal and build quality. So this was just my two cents.Samsung Galaxy S8 Unlocked 64GB - US Version (Midnight Black)"
"Amazon" "The most fragile phone I've ever owned. Such a piece of junk! My S5 lasted 3 years without a scratch and this has a broken screen from a 2 foot fall! Fell out of my pocket while sitting in a chair and the screen is shattered. Will never buy another Samsung product, even though my home is filled with them.Edit: I've been having fun destroying this POS phone since the first break. It's now virtually impossible to read the screen and the sad part is how simple it was to get it to this point. A couple of \"accidental\" drops and the screen is completely trashed! Almost worth the price of the phone for the pleasure of reducing it to what it really is,,, garbage."
"Amazon" "I have read a lot on this phone  and the reviews do not give it justice, on an unlock phone I had no problem going through Verizon to get a SIM's card  (my Galaxy Note 4 had a larger card. They did have to go to the 800 service to acknowledge the phone but it was up and running in no time. I do recommend a LifeProof case (Fre) it makes it water proof for those who do not want to scratch the screen it's warranty is great. This phone is fast and I was able to transfer all of my apps with Samsung smart switch app easy as pie. If any cons show up I will update this review."
"Amazon" "This phone is pretty good!Water resistant. Solid build quality. Battery lasts a decent amount of time compared to my iphone 7 I got rid of. Charges very quickly.Interface/operating system could be easier to use. Siri is easy. This bixby character is difficult. Hope it gets updated soon to make it much better. Needs it!"
"Amazon" "Entirely too fragile, screen broke after phone dropped two feet in a case. First time I have ever cracked a screen and I have dropped other galaxy and Apple phones further with zero damage. Repairs are almost as much as a new phone, ridiculous....looking at several owner forums it seems to be a design flaw"
"Amazon" "This phone sucks.  It keeps freezing and having errors and is unusable. I have not had a phone for months as Scamsung keeps refreshing the software and sending  it back to me. No one at Scamsung will honor the warranty. Last Scamsung product i will ever buy."
"Amazon" "The Samsung Galaxy S8 is extremely helpful with all the features it provides and while also looking really beautiful at the same time. With its Snapdragon 835 Processor it allows the phone to run appropriately fast, and allows the user to be able to run most programs that couldn't be run on previous generations. With that and the four gigabytes of ram the new Samsung Galaxy S8 allows for two windows to be up on the same time; this allows for great multitasking. Even though the internals of the S8 are powerful, the externals are just as good or even better. The Galaxy S8 is by far one of the sleekest phones out there with its infinity screen and beveled edge. The screen it has gives it more real estate which allows it to give a nice wide angle view and look amazing on most applications. While the beveled double edge looks really nice it also is a very useful addition because it gives you the option for an incognito quick menu.this menu has an ever growing amount of possibilities; because it holds more than your top 5 contacts and your top 10 apps. There is a whole selection of extra pages for your bar ranging from far more than a notepad or a full on calculator which can come in handy for real quick math in the samsung app store. The galaxy s8 has one of the best battery lives, for it can last nearly a whole day on a full charge with general use. It also is very durable even though the whole body is made of glass it can sure take a massive beating as well as its water resistant. The S8 has so many features that its hard to mention them all but it is one of the best, if not the best, phone out on the market right now."
"Amazon" "Samsung is really stepping up their game with the new S8 series. I previously had an S7 and didn't think I would be able to get over the bigger form factor or understand the point of the edge-to-edge display - but I was very wrong! I can't go back to a smaller phone now, the display is just too pretty to want anything else. Works seamlessly with the Gear 360 and VR systems, as expected. Battery life is amazing I could not believe how little I have to charge it now. Fingerprint scanner is in a weird place but nothing you can't get over.Tip: Buy a good case for the phone that makes you feel like it is still secure since you need to still use the edge for swiping."
"Amazon" "I fully expected this device to be bloatware free. It's not. Even when you \"disable\" the app there are services from that app still running in the background. One of the worst offenders is Facebook. Even if you're not on Facebook, and have disabled it, it is still running in the background."
"Amazon" "It's easily my best phone so far. The screen is really nice. The form factor is a great surprise. It's very easy to hold.The phone also has a great camera that is better than on any previous phone, a Nexus 5X.My biggest concern with Samsung phones was it's software, especially after coming from a pure Google phone. I have been pleasantly surprised how nice Samsungs have gotten. In many ways it is nicer to use than a pure Google phone.The battery life is great and so is the speed and the usability. In all its a great phone."
"Amazon" "Bought this phone as an upgrade from my previous phone. To put it bluntly, this thing is amazing. The way it feels in my hand is excellent. Now I have normal hands for a guy, so if you have smaller hands it may be a little big, but for me it was a perfect fit. The camera is a huge upgrade from my previous phone. The details are so crystal clear. The insane amount of settings really lets you customize your phone to what you want. The only thing I have to mention is Bixby. I turned mine off and downloaded the Google Assistant, but aside from that I literally cannot brag about this phone. If you're on the fence about it, just get it. Now I bought mine when it was $600, which as I'm writing this review Amazon has them priced at $720, so you might want to keep an eye on the price. But again, highly recommended. Amazing upgrade. Coworkers are jealous."
"Amazon" "My wife upgraded from a fairly old phone (the Nexus 5), so this was a huge leap to the next generation for sure! The photos it takes completely rivals any other phone I've seen (including my S7!) and not to mention it even seems sharper than my friends' iPhone pics. The phone, albeit on the large side, has an absolutely GORGEOUS screen and makes browsing and interacting an absolute pleasure every time it is fired up. Only drawback is that it's very difficult for one handed operations, but I'm not going to ding the number of stars for that because my wife knew what she was getting herself signed up for when purchasing such a large phone."
"Amazon" "I already had an S8 that I got through Verizon so I knew I liked the phone. It's sleek and beautiful and is practically my personal assistant. I wasn't sure if this unlocked version would be simple to activate, but we took the Verizon SIM card out of my daughter's dying S6 and put it in the S8 and it works perfectly, calls, texts, apps, etc. We didn't even have to go online to activate it! And if she wants to switch carriers, she can just get a new SIM card. This unlocked phone is the way to go."
"Amazon" "The phone gets scratches way too easily. This might be the last Samsung I buy."
"Amazon" "Paying almost 900 dollars for a phone and then some for a case you'd think it wouldn't break. My screen has shattered twice now. I've never broken a phone before in my life. I've never dropped this phone either. One minute it's fine and the next it's shattered. It was in my purse all day next to my cloth wallet. I never set my purse down nor did it get hit/leaned on/thrown/etc.. I pull out the phone and it's shattered. I'm so frustrated and angry that something this expensive would break for no apparent reason. TWICE. If I could give 0 stars, I would. This is absurd. I want my money back."
"Amazon" "Was supposed to be unlocked and compatible with cellular/data programs offered by, among other major providers, Verizon.  Well, it wasn't.  Finally took it to a Verizon store and was told that the phone was simply not compatible with Verizon. So Frustrating! It's so obvious the answer is the best course of action is to go to a provider brick and mortar store (in this case Verizon), and buy the phone there.  Whatever the difference in price is, if any, is more than offset by the time and hassle saved. Ugh!"
"Amazon" "cant say enough of how much I love this phone ... best samsung so far ... and  $200 less then t-mobile store for same phone"
"Amazon" "I purchased the phone and I transferred my data from my s7 in turn it made the phone not function properly. It wouldn't read my sim card. The volume bottom was not working so I couldn't hear conversations unless I had the phone on speaker. Two days of this and I did a master reset. Phone is working now but the in call volume is still an issue.  I would have loved to have everything transfer over without an issue. The phones camera is so awesome though. It's super clear! The split screen makes me love this phone. Samsung over Apple for sure. I was unsure when I originally switched but the pros outweigh the cons. The expandable memory is a huge plus! I'm sure as I get more familiar with this phone I'll learn to love it 100%"
"Amazon" "Love this phone! It is definitely an upgrade from my S5. It has a great camera. It is really cool to switch to selfie mode just by swiping the photo area. It like flips. I really like the edge. It is a really neat feature. It is also water resistant and can be immersed in water. So I can set it on the edge of the tub and not have to worry if I may accidentally knock it into the water. It does have a limit though. Read the manual. It is very user friendly just as all Samsung Galaxies are. I know there is so much more I could tell you but just know it is a great phone overall."
"Amazon" "I was trying to decide between the Iphone X or the Samsung 8 Plus. Waited for the X to come out to compre, butt after going to my nearest Apple Store and playing around for a while I decided on the S8 for several reasons: first screen size..second memory expansion...and third ...photo quality...night pictures come out like a pro! you may even take a picture with voice command on the S8. Also transfering data from your old phone was very simple with Samsung connect.Last but not least..price..you would have to pay $300 more for the X !I had the S8 for one day and is a great phone!"
"Amazon" "The Samsung Galaxy S8+ is a smart choice for a smartphone. This phone serves all the purposes you would expect in a modern smartphone and does so tremendously well. With a 3500 mAh battery, it lasts all day displaying all your information, entertainment, and communication needs on a beautiful edge to edge screen with a 6.2’’ Quad HD+ Super AMOLED technology with a easy to use UI (user Interface).As someone, who has been on #teamiPhone for the last 5 years making the switch was not an easy choice but after analyzing the market and realizing that now in the Fall of 2017 is the perfect time to switch markets. I switched markets and I am enjoying the S8 + more than I ever did a new generation iPhone. After letting my mom (a baby boomer) play with this new phone, it became quite clear that she could operate it with about the same level of competency as her iPhone 6+ running the latest OS. Granted, there is a steeper learning curve for older generations with newer technologies…I think it is safe to say that anyone at any age could operate the S8+ with ease and learn to enjoy life on the other side of the smartphone market. You should consider researching it further learning more about it’s incredible durability, waterproofing, and hardware specs."
"Amazon" "Being a tech junkie I love my toys but hate spending a ton for them.  Thank you for this incredible phone at an incredible price :-) Upgrading from an S5, this phone is super fast and after taking it to t-mobile to get the micro sim card, works flawlessly...so happy!"
"Amazon" "I love this phone,  this is the replacement of an iphone 5 and I don't miss it at all.  Before buying the Samsung Galaxy S8 I was debating if I should get the Iphone 8 instead but Apple's strategy of releasing 3 phones a couple months apart just didn't make sense to me, it makes you think.  After reading reviews explaining how Samsung has been releasing phones for years with technology that Apple now says is revolutionary with their Iphone X,  my decision was easily made... the S8 is an excellent phone with all the bells and whistles for an amazing price."
"Amazon" "Beautiful  screen..  lots of features......upgrade from my Nexus 6P..  just transferred  my sim....up and running in two minutes."
"Amazon" "This phone is amazing but has one massive flaw. The edge to edge screen, while it looks and performs amazingly is the downfall of this device. You will break this phone.You could put a case on it to protect the glass edges. However, the case will only be effective if it is also covering the edges of the screen that your phone will fall on when you drop it. So if the only way to realistically use this phone without having to replace it every time you drop it is to cover the main feature, the edge to edge screen with a case. So what is the point of the phone? Save your heartache with cracked screans and invest in any of the competitors that won't shatter on the first drop."
"Amazon" "This phone lives up to my expectations. One nice thing Samsung did was include multiple USB cable type adapters to make the transition to USB C less painful for those who have micro USB cables. Setup was easy, and with a T Mobile SIM from my less than flattering G6, booted right up and started working with the network. Build quality seems to be good.Bixby is interesting, and works about as well as Google's voice activation, if not slightly better, it at least tells you when it can't do something, and has a nice tutorial when you first swipe to its screen on the phone."
"Amazon" "I just upgraded from the Galaxy S5.  There's a little bit of a learning curve, but so far so good I love the phone.  I have verizon as my provider.  I went to the verizon store so they could help me active the phone, since I need a new SIM card.  The phone was activated with no problems."
"Amazon" "Do your research and you will see this is the most breakable phone ever.  Mine cracked twice .... Without dropping ... Even though I have the Samsung case designed to protect it.  Great phone but that $200 monthly deductible will drive you broke (no pun intended)!"
"Amazon" "I know posting this review after only a day of usage might seem bad to do, but I love the phone. I got the phone, had Verizon pop my Sim card in and it was ready to use. No hassle or anything. The phone flies through anything. The curved screen allows for you to grip it easily and is a pleasure to look at with the sharp screen when reading or watching videos. My only concern down the line would be the battery, but I carry a power bank with me anyways so thats a minor grip. Thank you Amazon for the great price. I loved my S6 but this phone has Wob me over."
"Amazon" "Hope I can cut through all the confusion posted here about Verizon compatibility.  THIS MODEL DOES INDEED WORK ON VERIZON'S NETWORK.  When I received the phone, I charged it to 100%, but did NOT turn it on.  I then took it to a Verizon store.  After a beat down by the salesperson for buying an unlocked phone online, she proceeded to warn me that lately, Verizon has been \"refusing to activate unlocked phones\" not purchased through them.  However, after standing my ground, the salesperson backed down, retrieved a SIM card and activated my new S8.  Be persistent!Awesome phone with wonderful features - and pretty snappy, too!  Everything is working great.  It is nice to own a phone without all the bloatware pre-installed."
"Amazon" "Outstanding replacement for my old Samsung SII which started acting a little funny.  Very clear screen, long battery life, and connects with the Bluetooth in all my vehicles in 8 seconds or less and never fails to connect."
"Amazon" "The Galaxy S8 is a wonderful phone with a fairly streamlined experience compared to other Android phones I've had. The camera is fantastic even in low light and it's super responsive. The only real issues I personally have with it are the Samsung pre-installed apps and that it doesn't have a better set of speakers. Otherwise, this is a great phone."
"Amazon" "Had an iPhone, switched to Android.  I'm very glad I did!  This phone is awesome and it's a great value. Recommended!"
"Amazon" "Weakest screen I've had on a phone. I had a Note7 and the screen was indestructible. When I brought it back to the store during the recall, after they refunded me they started throwing the phone to see how much force it could take before breaking. The store employees were tossing it high in the air and it would fall on their hardwood floor unscathed. They eventually got it to break after many, many throws but it withstood SO MUCH before finally shattering. I assumed the S8+ would have the same gorilla glass as the Note7. Nope! In fact, the S8+ has one of the most fragile screens out of any recently released phone. Look it up. Mine fell out of my pocket about 1.5 ft and shattered, also damaging the LCD itself. Additionally, I recently got an \"offer\" from Samsung as a Note7 owner to trade my phone in for a Note8-- they offered me \"up to $450\" for a phone that I paid significantly more for. This will probably be my last Samsung phone after my recent experiences with their products."
"Amazon" "Have been using this phone for about a month now, really liking it. Upgraded to the S8 from an S5, so I definitely think the speed and everything is better on this phone. Haven't had any problems with the phone and am loving the larger screen."
"Amazon" "I had a Nexus 6p, but it stopped working and I didn't want to fork out the money for a Pixel 2 so I decided to get the Sumsung S8 plus as part of Tmobiles buy one get one free deal. BOY WAS IT A MISTAKE. The Galaxy S8 is complete junk compare to my Nexus 6p. First of all the fingerprint reader is right NEXT to the camera!!! So it's very easy to mistake the Camera for the finger print reader when you are not looking and it usually takes me several tries to unlock the phone. Second the phone only have one speaker on the bottom compare to the stereo speaker in my 6p. And YES it does make a difference!! Third, the curve screen completely sucks, it warps videos and side of webpages and ebook. Lastly as of today, it still doesn't have support for the latest android software while my 6p already supported it. In all honesty if I had to choose all over again I would have chosen the LG V30 or Pixel 2 or IPhone X. Heck I would've chosen my old 6p over this phone. So yes please stay away from this phone, it's definitely not worth the price."
"Amazon" "Problems with the phone within two weeks, terrible experience with Samsung in Warranty repair who sent the phone whithout the simcard tray and 20 days later still not here. If your product stop working consider this advice, Samsung Warranty Services is terrible. My Phone is 4 month old and thanks to them i got to enjoy it for 10 days. I don't know when I'm going to be able to used again."
"Amazon" "I absolutely love this phone. I made the switch from apple to android with the latest phone updates and it was the best decision I could have made. There are so many more things you can customize with the phone and it's settings it really makes it personal."
"Amazon" "I purchased this phone on a Monday, by Thursday the back was cracked. I never dropped it, I never bumped it, I never even put it in my pocket with anything else. When I contacted Samsung they said that I could send it back and be without a phone for a week, and then they would determine if it was a manufacturing defect (and fix it) or decide that it was user abuse (and they would charge me to fix it or return it broken). Since this interaction, it is clear to me that Samsung does not stand behind their products, and that they do not care about customer satisfaction."
"Amazon" "Amazing phone. I bought mine from Costco, but I have not had any issues with my Galaxy. The 64 GB of storage is more than enough for my apps, photos and music. The battery life is exceptional and the fast charging adapter that comes with all Galaxy phones is amazing for quickly getting some juice while you are in a rush. Wireless charging is amazing in that I only need to set my phone down and it will begin charging. I switched from the iPhone 7 Plus and I do not see myself going back to Apple anytime soon."
"Amazon" "This phone is awesome. I love it so far. The only thing is the battery. I thought it would be better."
"Amazon" "I am sure I would have liked this phone as I had done plenty of research before purchasing. The phone itself is fine however upon boot it appeared to be defaulted to Spanish. Not a good sign. The phone is touted to be an unlocked US version of the phone, however, this does not appear to be the case for the one I got. After changing the language for the phone and pulling the version number (SM-G950F), I determined this one to be a European version. There is NO CDMA radio capability and Verizon fails to provision this phone on their network. A bit disappointed and returning."
"Amazon" "They said new, but...... it didn't have a plastic seal on it, and the screen cover has been tempered with.... but not scratches. Which was really satisfying to look at"
"Amazon" "I have this phone and it is now less than 4 weeks old.  Overnight as it was charging it came up with a moisture detection message and it won't charge.  It has not been in water although it claims to be \"water resistant\".  The bubble gum answer of use a blow dryer or clean with a Qtip are not working and again, it hasn't been in water.  If the humidity in the air can render a phone less than a month old unusable it is worthless.  Move on to a better option because as you can see on the forum sites, people all over are experiencing the problem.  It is either a hardware or software problem.  The consensus seems to be that it became a problem after the last system update."
"Amazon" "I just replaced the Galaxy S5 with a Galaxy S8.  The screen is beautiful, camera takes amazing photos, better battery performance, and improved signal strength.  However I think the texting feature has taken a step back overall but worst of all, the voice-to-text feature is atrociously poor, constantly misspelling words (like 'clubutt' instead of Columbus), despite repeated attempts of speaking slowly and clearly. Also when texting the auto-suggestion and auto-correction feature routinely provides incorrect options."
"Amazon" "The Samsung Galaxy S8+ is a pleasure to navigate and use for the modern device. The screen is clean and sharp and the color is exceptional. It is nicely weighted, and the fit is very comfortable. The phone's accessibility, from dialing to apps, is phenomenal and intuitive, and very user-friendly. The fingerprint reader makes it extremely convenient and secure to access your phone by the tip of your hand. The camera quality is absolutely incredible. However, one feature that may come across as underuse would be the feature that allows you to alphabetize your apps! The phone overall is relatively effective, efficient and entertaining!"
"Amazon" "Do not buy from A)MA)ZON warehouse. I am sure this phone is great, but the one I received was missing the SIM card cover and conductor plate, and no earphone. So, sad to say, Christmas is ruined by A)MA)ZON warehouse. Wish I had this phone in actual working order. Not even sure if this review will go through, A)MA)ZON cancelled my previous review of this product."
"Amazon" "Awesome phone. I got it when it was on sale for $575 and it hasn't failed me yet. I love the fact that it's unlocked so I could pretty much pop any sim card into it and have service. I really wanted it in orchid gray but the black was on sale for significantly cheaper (I believe the full price is about $750-800) so I stuck with that one. The battery life lasts me all day even through my heavy use. It hasn't died on me yet."
"Amazon" "This phone is reliable.. but that's all I like about it.  It's smooth, slippery, glass front and back, and is quite possibly the most fragile thing I've ever touched. If you frequently venture far from the safety of your bed, or someplace afflicted by the ravages of gravity, this device is the wrong choice."
"Amazon" "The Samsung Galaxy S8 I was shipped had model number SM-G950F, which is the international version of the phone, not the US version as specified in this item.I recently got lines of dead pixels in my S8 and Samsung refuses to pay for it because the international version of the phone does not have a warranty coverage as promised in this item."
"Amazon" "I am going to review what I consider the most important features of a phone.Screen (5/5): literally, the most beautiful display I have ever seen. At first, I wasn't sure how the whole curved screen thing was going to play out but after just one day with it I was already questioning if I could ever go back to a normal flat screen. It's awesome.Battery (5/5): I put this thing through its paces. The first few days I used Youtube a ton and played a bunch of games to get a feel for how fast the battery drains. To make it short and to the point, you could obviously drain the whole battery if you turned the brightness to max and just played graphics intensive games for hours, but if we're talking about moderate to heavy use for the average adult then this thing will last all day without even making it to critical levels. I think the lowest I've seven seen the battery after a normal day's use (lots of texting, some phone calls, a few games and some Youtube videos) is like 40%.Storage (5/5): Pretty simple to review this. 64GB is probably enough for most people, and even if it's not you can insert a microSD card.Call clarity (4/5): At first, I didn't realize I had the HD Calling feature on. This made the caller's voice seem super digital and weird, I didn't like it. After I switched it off, it improved the quality but it wasn't the best I've heard. By no means is it bad, just not the best,Feel (4/5): It's a long phone, so if you have small hands you might want to play around with it a little before buying. I have large hands so it isn't as much of a problem for me, but I can see why this might become an issue for others.Speaker quality (5/5): I was pleasantly surprised by the volume and quality of the speakers. Don't get me wrong, they are cell phone speakers, but compared to other phones the S8's sound is above average.Feel (5/5): This thing is sleek. I bought a minimalist case for it because I loved the way it felt in my hand. A few times, I had a moment of panic because I couldn't feel that it was still in my pocket. If you are prone to dropping your phone, I suggest getting a protection plan or a rugged case. I have not dropped mine yet, but I can easily imagine a single drop on a hard surface from waist level breaking the screen if it lands directly on it. The screen is supposedly pretty tough, but I wouldn't test it.If I think of more things to review I will update this, but for now I think that's all I have to say about the Samsung S8. Overall, I've never felt more impressed by a new phone"
"Amazon" "Had this phone for a couple months now and I thoroughly enjoy all the features especially the camera. The quality of the camera (which is important to me because I take a lot of pictures) is great and I like the sleek design. Be careful of the always on display. It can burn your screen."
"Amazon" "I was very happy that I upgraded to the S8 and was loving it all week until I realized it wouldn't let me connect to any wifi at all besides the one at my home. My college has free wifi and it worked perfectly fine on my S7edge, but on my S8, it said wifi is blocked. I tried wifi in Mcdonalds, parks, restaurants, and the wifi are all blocked. What on earth? It said I should contact my phone provider or what not and I am kind of really upset."
"Amazon" "Worst phone ever. Samsung is worst service. Do not buy this/Samsung products. Software updates ruin the phone and due to purchasing via Amazon the service isn't good. It's US Warranty phone but doesn't cover the same as a store bought or direct Samsung bought. Bought it 3 months ago and still suffering with a non functional phone."
"Amazon" "Bixby, is new voice assistant from samsung,  that can't be deleted.  if you like  alexis, and google voice, now you have a new voice command.  if you don't want that, tough.the extra button on the left side will activate Bixby, and can not be deactivated -per samsung tech support.  I can't recommend this phone because of bixby."
"Amazon" "This phone is the best! Love how it looks, how it works, and it's not heavy or big at all."
"Amazon" "Accidently broke my phone and needed a replacement.  This one works exactly like my last one and saved my self a couple 100 bucks. Compatible with sprint. Perfect new condition!"
"Amazon" "Love This phone. Was a little hard to type with the curved screen at first. I kept bumping letters with the sides of hands while hanging on to the phone. I recommend a case for it. Once I put that on I didn't have any more problems because now my hands are resting on the case and not on the actual screen. I use an otter box."
"Amazon" "Pros and cons are well stated in the reviews. All I can add is that despite everything, you will love your galaxy phone! Especially if you are coming from as old device as Galaxy S4. I remember vividly watching Samsung's reveal of beautiful S4. For those who don't know, S4 is the best selling smartphone of all time which, even to this date, performs quite well unlike competitor's smartphone of same generation. Even from that perspective, Samsung has come a long way in terms performance (much better touchwiz), ux (perfect mix of simplicity and feature-fullness for adv. users) and most noticeably design - S8 is the marvel of industrial design and I only hope Samsung will continue delivering innovation on the market for many more years."
"Amazon" "This is by far one of Samsung's best products switched from iPhone 7 and wow Apple needs to step their game up"
"Amazon" "Best cell phone I've had. The colors are vibrant, the camera's great not to mention lots of features. I haven't used bixby due to the reviews but I'm fine without it."
"Amazon" "Got 2 of these (other one was from Best Buy) plus a S8+ for myself.  Definitely a great phone and used with the Samsung 360 camera and VR headset.  Got cases from Otterbox to protect the devices.  I won't comment on the user interface as it is really a personal choice. At least some of my family members are happy."
"Amazon" "I have owned the galaxy S2,S3, and S6(flat Display). With all of those phones I was happy from purchase, to replacement (usually fleeting battery life). I have just purchased two(one for me and my significant other) of the Galaxy S8+ phones, and am somewhat disappointed. I was reluctant to purchase at first because of the edge screen being forced upon me, but I could no longer deal with old phones. Here are some of the things I have noticed.Cons1. Screen glare - when in lit areas I seem to always have a glare on one side of the edge. Even in Samsung's display pictures there are glares on both sides of the screen. (hard to be unseen once noticed)2. Screen protectors - I have tried 3 so far none seem to like to stick to the screen well and two interfere with cases I've tried.3. Cases - Not a problem yet, but all the cases I have tried seem leave something to be desired in protection. A lot of the front of the phone seems uncovered.(very nerve racking, mostly due to curved screen)4. Finger print scanner - WHY OH WHY IS IT ON THE BACK? Next to the camera non the less. Unlocking with single hand can be a little tedious. Because hand placement for use, and unlocking it are different. Kind of have to slide it around your had to do one or other. Thick cases can make it hard to get proper finger placement.5. On screen buttons - I have had phones with them before, HTC M8. After about a year the phone slows a touch, and they seem to take a couple seconds to appear. May be an no issue with this in the future.Pros - (most other flagships are equal here)1. Battery - Very good battery life. After a day of moderate use its still over 40% remaining.2. Speed - A very fast phone, little to no lag launching apps.3. OS - I do like the Samsung version of android over some of the other companies. Probably because I've had so many of their devices.4. Camera - Very fast and great pictures. video recording is very high quality too.In conclusion, I would recommend looking at other options if you are on the fence about the infinity(edge) display.  I took a chance and do slightly regret it. I am currently stuck with the phone for most likely the next few months.Only way I'll buy a Samsung again is if,1. I can get a flat display again2. Take the buttons off the screen.3. Bring fingerprint scanner back to front."
"Amazon" "Blown away with the performance of the device.The phone is one hell of a beast with the most advanced hardware and blazing fast real world performance.Its almost bezel less screen design will put any other smartphone user to shame.The camera is something which has still got the best overall performance.Truly a phone which looks way ahead of time.Very happy with the purchase made, you definitely suggest to anyone looking to upgrade to flagship device."
"Amazon" "This is the nicest phone I've ever had. I was worried buying something this expensive from somewhere other than the manufacturer but it arrived on time and in the original box. Was a breeze setting up and the resolution is absolutely amazing"
"Amazon" "Works great was worried that it wouldn't but in posting this review on my new phone!!!"
"Amazon" "I got the box for the phone but no phone inside, yet I still got all the accessories that came with the phone"
"Amazon" "Replacing my note 4. Nice phone.... T-Mobile store pro was impressed with the deal I got for this ....Still figuring out Bixby.... I thought it would turn off the ping notifications sounds.... either I have more tutorials to do, or it just tells me how to do this.😃"
"Amazon" "The  Phone is very good with many new functions. I like the edge design. Also bixby and samsung health is a good addition. Holds the charge almost for a day if you are actively using it but the charger is not functioning after 4 months."
"Amazon" "Gorgeous phone. All glass. Fingerprint sensor location is not so bad as reviews indicate.Disabling app power manager/optimize battery is a must for receiving notifications in timely manner. If you need just led notifications but no sound, you need to download and use silent.mp3 tone.Bixby button not so scary since it can be remapped.Looks frigile I would never use a case, so really hope I don't drop it.Very nice deal at $460, thanks amazon!"
"Amazon" "I loved it at 1st then the keyboard started giving me issues. Everything else is great but I have press really hard to type anything."
"Amazon" "Great phone but had to return. I have T-mobile and this unlocked doesn't do video calling and predictive text only branded T-mobile devices do this."
"Amazon" "True that it's was unlocked , what wasn't stated was the fact it was a sprint unlocked phone. Loaded with tons of useless sprint bloat ware. Need to root to get rid of all if it. But it works and it's a galaxy s8"
"Amazon" "Bought this phone the other day as a replacement for a Samsung On5 phone that only had 8GB memory but worked ok just slow. Just wanted to have something better with more memory and a unlocked version. This phone seems to have some great features which I'm still exploring. The display and camera is awesome! A little pricey but in the ballpark with other competitors brands/prices. Very happy so far."
"Amazon" "I've had my phone since maybe August. I immediately put a screen protector and case on the thing. Screen has two cracks, and it's not worth paying Verizon my deductible to get another just like it. The edge screen is not protected well by any case I've tried, so that's where cracks form. Also, it's impossible to get a decent screen protector that sits well on the screen if you're using a case. I am terribly disappointed."
"Amazon" "HTC one, and ASUS zenfone 3 user. The quality of the phone, looks, apps, security iris scanner. Battery life functions features. Best phone I ever had. Fits perfect in hand if you like a good regular phone."
"Amazon" "I bought an open box return. It was just like new. I like the size of the phone. It's a little bit longer but, it is thinner. That makes it easier to hold. It came unlocked and I was able to get it on my cell phone provider's network without any problems or surprises."
"Amazon" "Great price for a flagship phone, upgraded from Google Pixel and love the screen on this phone. Best phone I've ever owned."
"Amazon" "Awesome phone! It's beautiful, technically advanced, responsive and did not bring too much bloatware. I'v always had Galaxy S phones and this is the best."
"Amazon" "I purchased this phone at the october 23 and I have in my hands now and is a incredible phone.I've been a little bit worry because my purchase is a Verizon unblocked phone,  you know for the CDMA theme but the CDMA the phone is both CDMA AND the GSM NETWORK so I only put it the metro pcs sim and the mtropcs girl do it her magic and work very well and fast. Of course  I paid for the new SIM  and $15 dollars to fee"
"Amazon" "Excellent condition as described. Unlocked model so there's no bloatware. I'm happy with this purchase."
"Amazon" "S8+ is a really well made phone and has a nice feel when you hold it in your hand. Recommend taking Accident protection plan. The much criticized Bixby is not too bad and you need to spend time to train your assistant, after that it works great. Never expected another company to beat Apple in build quality, looks and intuitive interface....Samsung S8+ proved me wrong.... love the phone"
"Amazon" "I live in Turkey. Bought this, sent it over to a friend in the US.It works fine with my carrier here. The packing was new, everything came out of the package as expected (charger, earphones, etc)Just a reminder, if you are going to use it somewhere else, do not forget to buy yourself a plug adapter, since the one that comes out of the box is the US plug.Handsome phone.. loved it"
"Amazon" "Read reviews and various positive comment ... all are true and useful for decision making! One bit lower, keyboard only English .. that is unfortunate, should have a version with 2 languages and more with predictable and dictionary features available!"
"Amazon" "Great phone, amazing picture quality and battery life. Smooth processor and operating system. Amazed."
"Amazon" "Pleased. Be sure of passwords. I got in a mess. Very slippery. Get a good case."
"Amazon" "Item received on time. After a couple of days of use the speakers did not work anymore. The device has been restoring media for several days  with a current recovery progress of 11% (73 MB out of 656 MB), the wireless charger stops working continuously and the Wi-Fi connection also stops working with no reason. I have been out of country for a month and for this reason return time was closed."
"Amazon" "Worked with my T-Mobile simPerfect for gsm the reviews had me confused people Talking about Verizon and sprint i thought it wouldnt Work with tmobile but it does lte at is best"
"Amazon" "This is a quality phone, its fast, it has expandavle storage and it was created this year and is one of the cheaper flagships and although I prefer Google assistant bixby does a good job at what it was designed to do. Bixby can download apps for you if you are to lazy to type and that is basically all I use it for, otherwise Google assistant all the way."
"Amazon" "Edit : Added a photo of my cracked phone (The red light is from my led strip)This phone was awesome until a 2 feet drop. The screen was shattered and I had a bitter experience. I haven't fixed the phone at the moment because it will cost $200. YES! TWO FREAKING HUNDRED DOLLARS man. I got the phone from Samsung website for $561, not from Amazon. However, I couldn't write a review on their website because I think they realize that they make a trash phone that can crack when you fart on it. If you wanna know how I think about the phone here is the list of pros and cons.Pros :- Vibrant color screen- OOOOO So sleek design- \"VIRTUALLY\" Indestructible- Free AKG headphones- Decent camera- LED notification indicator- Samsung \"smart\" switch- Good music playerCons:- Indestructible my ass- Easily crack screen and they will suck your money out- They don't care how you drop it but you will have to pay- Cracking the screen will void you from your warranty- Rear can be scratched easily- Awkward finger print scanner- Apps always crash- Best phone my assAvoid Samsung at all costPS. I just dropped it in the afternoonand I WANT MY REFUNDDON'T BUY SAMSUNG EVER AGAIN!!! THEIR PHONES ARE TERRIBLE"
"Amazon" "Great phone but has few cons comes with it. It gets scratch  very easy; from front to back. So get a screen protector  and  a case *asap* if not you will regret it. I sure did."
"Amazon" "This phone has been amazing! I purchased it when it was roughly $550. Retail price was $850 with T-Mobile (ridiculous)! Overall the phone has worked amazing. Only complaint is that the screen protectors for this phone (purchased separately) makes it super hard to type.Overall, love this phone!!!"
"Amazon" "I purchased the unlocked version of the galaxy s8 plus. When the item arrived instead of it being the s8+ they somehow crammed a galaxy s7 edge in the galaxy s8 edge box. BUYER BEWARE!!!!!"
"Amazon" "This is a great phone let down by one major flaw of a super scratchy screen. I have had an S3 and and S5 in the past and this was a step up. I love the display, the memory, the speed, and the color. If it was just for that I would have given this phone 5 stars. I have had this phone for only 3 days and there is already a bunch of scratches on the screen. And deep enough to pick up with your fingernail. I never had this problem with the previous Samsung phones. In fact I went caseless for the entire 2 year life of the S5 and only picked up one scratch when it fell to the floor of the truck once. I haven't treated this phone any different and have not dropped it or otherwise abused it but there are still noticeable scratches and marks. This alone makes the phone a \"DO NOT BUY\" in my book. Maybe if it was HALF THE PRICE but not at over $600. I seriously think that the screen isn't even glass but PLASTIC. A big step backward for Samsung."
"Amazon" "Best phone I've had yet! Beautiful display and advanced features. It takes beautiful pictures, has fast charge and long lasting battery life. Charged My phone once and didn't have to charge it again for two to three days and that was with me being on it a lot. My last phone was the lg flex and I wasn't as big on it so I decided to go back to Samsung again and my am I happy with my decision. Would recommend anyone to definitely give this phone a go. It's pretty expensive but it's worth it. Great phone!"
"Amazon" "The screen is a great size, it runs fast, its slick and sleek. And now Samsung has finally allowed you to disable the Bixby button! Texting is oddly very slow but I can live with that."
"Amazon" "Came from jailbroken iPhone because I thought I could do whatever I want with my android after I bought it, such as rooting. Samsung apparently didn't get the memo of what android stands for, user customizability. Rooting is damn near impossible on this crappy phone. This phone misses on all the little things I didn't appreciate on my iphone. These things include actually sending music metadata to my car over Bluetooth, not unlocking my phone everytime Bluetooth makes and ends a call, not unlocking my phone when I miss a call."
"Amazon" "It is an ok phone nice features but Samsung used poorly made screens on this phone. I have had S3, 5, 7 and now 8 and the 8 is scratch every other day its seems like. The glass is either fake or they just used junk glass to make up for their loses last year.I would not recommend you spend this amount of money on a sub-par Smart Phone, poor craftsmanship."
"Amazon" "Great phone. Still learning the Android way. Finely gave up on Windows 10 Mobile."
"Amazon" "I could NOT be more happy. This is where I will buy all my devices from here on out."
"Amazon" "Great phone. Great battery life. LOVE that it still has an earphone jack."
"Amazon" "The phone itself keeps rebooting and restarting every 3 min or so for NO REASON at all just like some LG phones which did irritated me whileago... plus Did I even mention this particular device is too fragile and super duper susceptible to cracking? Yup.. in the other reviews despite its own beautiful designs and so far no battery explosion issues after Note 7 fiasco way back in September 2016 aka They did develop 8 points battery safety check. T hats one star I just added......"
"Amazon" "I was skeptical but I love it!! I use it with Straight Talk and works perfectly! 😚"
"Amazon" "I used to have a windows phone now I have this I  Am glad I upgraded"
"Amazon" "If you're considering a Samsung S8+ just know, my phone has terrible burn-in on the AMOLED screen. Just went a week without the phone while it went back to Samsung for repair. I got it back and there's dirt behind the screen. They now want the phone back again. Terrible customer service"
"Amazon" "If I could disable bixby button I would give this phone 5 starts."
"Amazon" "The phone was very nice. But the problem is the wifi. Sometimes it cannot.detect the wifi and not working properly becuase it will automatic wifi off now i have to bring it to samsung service center"
"Amazon" "This phone is amazing. Pretty much all I can say for now considering it's just my first week. And for those curious, yes , this can be activated on MetroPCS. The process took about 2 minutes."
"Amazon" "My daughter she got gift on her birthday she loves her phone ."
"Amazon" "this phone is my new best friend and I dont need any human friends anymore because this little contraption is wonderful"
"Amazon" "I LIKE IT ! never had this new an fancy before LOL only thing I don't like is no voicemail notification. I don't know if its because it not a Verizon phone which is who I have as a carrier or what ? Also I had to go to a Verizon store to activate they will say it wont work for Verizon but if you keep on them or find a tech sales person who is willing to try an not just say no they can push it threw or whatever they do just takes a little doing on there part but it will work on Verizon"
"Amazon" "Love the phone.  No useless Verizon apps.  Great price!"
"Amazon" "Paid for a used damaged package Samsung 8 And received a Brand  new Samsung 8 unused and untouched.I have absolute perfect 4GLTE service with cricket wireless  Since I got this device .Best $400 I've ever spent"
"Amazon" "Just the right size: not to large to hold easily and not too small to have to strain to see.  All the bells and whistles I'll need for awhile!"
"Amazon" "I paid money for new one, but from this packaging, I don't feel this is the NEW one. The phone's protection membrane is intact, but I still highly doubt that this is a return product from other!"
"Amazon" "Just received my new phone in the mail! Looks real nice! Just found out that I have to have a sims card from Sprint (my service provider) in order to use it! Fortunately, they told me the sims card is free, and that I can either order one or go to the store and get it there! We shall see!"
"Amazon" "No issues and takes even nicer photos than my last phone."
"Amazon" "Phone works on Verizon, girl in the store was surprised. Great phone!"
"Amazon" "Love my s8 best phone I've ever had hands down! They have awesome customer service when it comes to buying this phone from Amazon my first phone sent out to me had a camera and screen issue but after talking to Amazon about it I was sent a replacement right away."
"Amazon" "Excellent Product and seller 100% recommended"
"Amazon" "YEHAA!!!  Loving and 'learning' my S8!!"
"Amazon" "Took a bit to get use to but its been amazing."
"Amazon" "Best phone I've ever owned. Screen is beautiful. Camera excellent. And yes, it had an FM antenna not requiring WiFi or mobile data to hear local FM stations. Samsung apps are excellent great improvements over stock Android."
"Amazon" "Great Phone, Now if I can master it."
"Amazon" "everythings was fine. Its a good seller."
"Amazon" "S7 Edge screen broke so I picked this up and preferred the size/feel over the plus.  What an awesome device, incredible how quickly we move on to the \"next best thing\" this phone is still A+!  Download Nova Launcher and you have the finest phone on the market"
"Amazon" "The screen, camera, and overall build are phenomenal.The Samsung version of Android is complete crap. The only version of Android that should be put on flagships is the pure version, plain and simple. Why does Samsung still have a proprietary app for everything Google already does so well? Then I have to tell the phone that I want to use the Google version for every default app. Don't even get me started about the fact that Facebook is preinstalled and CAN'T BE UNINSTALLED. I don't even have a Facebook account.. You can't remap the Bixby button to Google Assistant without a third party app? I simply disabled it to prevent myself from accidentally opening that crap assistant. The software for a 2017 flagship is atrocious.One of the selling points of this phone for me was the SD card expansion option. I bought a 128 GB SD card and downloaded all my Spotify music for offline use and all was good. Until one day, about 2 weeks into owning the phone, the SD card reader simply stopped working. After checking out some forums I realized this is an issue that Samsung won't address. This was the straw that broke the camel's back and I couldn't forgive Samsung for all the things I didn't like about the phone. I sent it back within 2 weeks of owning it.If you want a pure Android experience with great hardware, this is not the phone for you. If you're switching from an iOS device, or simply aren't into customizing your experience AND you don't mind not having advertised SD card support, go for it."
"Amazon" "Great product, fast, stylish. The only thing I complained is that the text on the phone edge is somewhat warped. We are using AT&T cellular service and the phone works well."
"Amazon" "Awesome phone except the bixby button."
"Amazon" "Like it, still learning how to make use of all the options."
"Amazon" "Definitely one of the best of 2017.Not giving 5star because Samsung chose to play safe with quick charge 2.0 rather than using a more recent iteration"
"Amazon" "So disappointed in this phone.  The bezeled edge makes it difficult to hit certain buttons, ads are popping up all of the time.  Just not a good phone, so many things have changed, and in a bad way.  Things just disappear off of the screen, ie, phone call, alarm, music, and I can't get them back easily.  Just plain sucks!!!!  Been using for about 3 months now and wish I had purchased an iphone.  Have been an Android fan for about a decade.  Definitely will next time."
"Amazon" "AWESOME!!!! THANK YOU!!!!"
"Amazon" "Phone looks and works great! The only problem is that Boost Mobile could not activate it due to carrier technology incompatibility. This phone does NOT work with Boost. She had to switch carriers."
"Amazon" "Working as expected .. so far."
"Amazon" "Great battery life. Getting through a full day of work under heavy use with 30% battery left. With my battery case on, it getting 2 day battery!"
"Amazon" "Amazing cell phone. Fast delivery. Amazon has just made a amazing job, i will recommend to all my friends. The cell phone arrived perfectly."
"Amazon" "Super good phone made the switch from apple just in time. Buying it off amazon will still save a few hundred bucks opposed to getting it on a plan through carrier because the carriers total price is higher. So if you want a new phone and can to pay up front save some money and get this one."
"Amazon" "Very good phone, very pretty."
"Amazon" "Very Nice"
"Amazon" "MMS will not work.  Talked to AT&T and they said its the phone.  I called Samsung and they said I should call AT&T."
"Amazon" "Works perfectly.  Just plop in your carrier SIM card and works great, and you don't get all of those forced app downloads that take up your memory."
"Amazon" "I just completed a consumer survey online. This description is different from Amazon's and may be of interest:\"Introducing the Samsung Galaxy S8.Key Features: IP68 Water and Dust Resistant The expansive display stretches from edge to edge allowing you to see more while scrolling less.Powerful Performance: Packing powerful performance and connectivity, the GS8 & GS8+ feature the industry's first mobile 10 nm chip, enabling heightened speed and efficiency.Bixby Vision: Built into your Camera.

"Amazon" "I have been a IPhone user for some years but got feed up with the prices Apple charges. so I went with Samsung, The camera is very good the screen quality is great. the reason I only give it 3 stars is the edge screen is very easy to touch and easily changes things just by holding the phone.A few things that bug me might have to do with user control. For example having different sounds for different apps,Facebook,messanger,emails and so on does not seem to work or at least I have not made it happen. At the moment I seem to get a ring or ding but then when I go to check my phone I have nothing showing I have missed a message. Again this could be me so if I can figure this phone out I will happily update my review."
"Amazon" "Recently switched from and iPhone 7 to the s8+. Bought from this merchant and I am very very pleased with the phone. It came it today and there was not 1 single scratch anywhere on the phone. It looks brand new! Would highly recommend this merchant!"
"Amazon" "So far, so good, this phone does so much more then I would have imagined, as well as things I never could imagine. Its way smarted then I am."
"Amazon" "Love the camera, love the phone, love the memory card slot, love the speed. If I could put a battery in it worth while I would give it 6 stars."
"Amazon" "The phone is amazing and the delivery was really fast!The phone arrived in perfections conditions.Galaxy 8 is a beautiful cell phone and the camera can take some gorgeous pictures.I would definitely recommend it."
"Amazon" "Galaxy is always right"
"Amazon" "Perfect condition and extremely happy with purchase. The wife loves it"
"Amazon" "Best phone I've ever owned very fast great screen and sound just awsome."
"Amazon" "good"
"Amazon" "Galaxy is the best!"
"Amazon" "Couldn't be more pleased. This phone has surpassed all my expectations. Well all except poor Bixby. That one was a disappointment. But the screen, oh THE SCREEN! Just won't quit! Love love love!"
"Amazon" "Long time iPhone user. This is my first time buying something else.  Bought this phone and fell in love."
"Amazon" "Beautiful device. Fits a little smaller in hand vs previous Galaxy and runs just as smooth. Aesthetically pleasing and the slightly larger screen is gorgeous. All black themes look so nice with this. Would 10/10 buy again"
"Amazon" "Really good amazon prime day deal.Phone works with Sprint (just had to get one of their $10 BYOD sim card)"
"Amazon" "Awesome cellphone, I made the mistake to put the soft screen protector while the cellphone was charging, the port got wet with the solution of the screen protector, so an error message about not charging while wet appear on the screen, I was afraid I damaged the cellphone. However after I got it dry, I just clear the cache of the USB on settings, and the message didn't  come back. Everything is great about this cellphone."
"Amazon" "Amazing product!the only downside that i can tell  about this phone is the localiton of the fingerprint sensor."
"Amazon" "Does not have the original lamination and the packaging is a little different. i have bought bought 3 s8+ and a note 8 so I know."
"Amazon" "Cannot get Verizon voice mail or Family Base to work on this phone.  Verizon says there is no way to add these services!  Wish this had been clear in the description before I purchased.  I have found NO VOICE MAIL APP that will work on this phone!"
"Amazon" "My first Android Device, Lovin It!!"
"Amazon" "The Phone!(C'mon, do a little research)"
"Amazon" "Excellent fit as usual. Slight ridge on sides sometimes interferes with buttons but no biggie. Very good access to the fingerprint scanner which is a weakness of their main competitor--a crucial plus if this is what you rely on to turn on the screen. 'Grippiness' comes with time as finger oils penetrate the back. Good product."
"Amazon" "5++ stars. Brand new and high quality product. Best performance. Fast shipping. Best seller."
"Amazon" "Update:  New phone has arrived and is working great. Five starts for Amazon customer service,  4 stars for the phone(the first one was defective but if not for that, would be five stars)Like the phone while its working, seems to be quick and the pictures seem really nice,  I'm unfortunately one of the ones that have been affected by the constant restarting problem.  Two stars for now since Amazon customer service is replacing it,  once the new one gets here and it doesnt have the restarting problem(restarts at random 15-20 times a day) I'll update the score/review."
"Amazon" "One word amazing"
"Amazon" "Worth it."
"Amazon" "Amazon warehouse deal it said used-like new and this is a steal!"
"Amazon" "This is best experience of all the smart phones I have tried yet and I have tried all from iPhone 3s,Nokia Lumia till iphone 7 and many more in the mix."
"Amazon" "This is a great phone. It does most of what it's supposed to and is a huge upgrade from my S6. Took one star away since it advertises use of the fingerprint scanner as a means to take pictures with the front facing camera. It doesn't work. I called Samsung support many times and even got a replacement phone. Still didn't work. Face recognition doesn't work particularly well either. Iris scan is a better option and that works nicely.Not the phone's fault, but getting this thing from Amazon was a nightmare. Now I have to return the second one they sent out because it's no better than the first and actually a little worse in some ways (home button not as receptive, Bixby button finicky, and still no fingerprint shooting method). Still happy with my choice, but 3 stars seems appropriate."
"Amazon" "If you don't mind surrendering your integrity by lying, saying you've read the thousands of legal words about Bixby, you can use the app. OTOH, if you prefer to retain your integrity (but don't want to spend the time to read all of that), it remains unusable, but will pop up anyway every time you accidentally hit the physical button toward the middle of the left side of the phone. There were ways to remap this with apps, but Samsung apparently got around that with the latest update, showing their complete disdain for their customers. This is not my first Samsung, but will probably be my last."
"Amazon" "Excellent product. Works well"
"Amazon" "Fast, good looking, good size, long battery, good sound, great camera, huge storage, never brakes. Didn't activated Bixby, however."
"Amazon" "I give this phone a five star because I have had no problems with it ever since I got it. It is the most beautifully designed phone on the market. Absolutely love the curved edges and the oled display. I is definitely worth the money."
"Amazon" "This is the worst NON apple phone ever.  It is very slick and difficult to handle, resulting in it frequently crashing to the floor.  I have used several apps that require the phone to be rest by removing frquently the battery--something that cannot be done with the S8.  The curved screen results in apps too often being opened inadvertently.  There appears to be no way to disable Bixby and the button is in a very difficult spot to avoid--extremely annoying.  Much of the functionality of previous devices is gone or virtually impossible to find.  Worst of all, IT CAME WITH NO INSTRUCTIONS!!!!!!!!!!!  THIS WILL BE MY LAST SAMSUNG PHONE."
"Amazon" "Easily the best android device released in 2017. A few software quirks and slow updates keep it from 5 stars."
"Amazon" "Fantastic phone. I haven't own a Galaxy phone since the S3. I went to iPhone and now I'm back on Galaxy and oh boy this phone is great. There are so many features on this phone that it would take me hours to explain them all in detail. They are great. From wireless charging, fast charging, the Iris scanner, and the gorgeous display. The screen has Gorilla Glass 5 and it's not easy to ruin with scratches. Be careful with buying screen protectors though with a case because thanks to the edges, cases will lift up the screen protectors from the bottom so you will need to find screen protectors that are case compatible. That was only problem I suppose that i've had so far. Otherwise, the phone is amazing and you won't be disappointed."
"Amazon" "This phone is amazing"
"Amazon" "Wife loves phone over her S7 Edge, I ordered another one for me. Really like the design and screen."
"Amazon" "Arrived on time and is unlocked.  Just perfect!!! Totally in love of my new phone."
"Amazon" "I do love the design of this phone nice and sleek easy to handle.  Quick and has tons of memory witch is wonderful plus I added an extra storage on top of that.  The camera is the best yet so clear and captures the true light and colors, my family are iPhone lovers however this one had made a few of them switch up.  One of the fastest running phones I've owned yet absolutely in love with this"
"Amazon" "Bought it months ago after clinging to my S4 for too long and I am in love with the many features."
"Amazon" "No bloatware.  Allot of memory for more stuff. Not slow at all. Excellent way to transfer your stuff from other phone. Love it. I'm in IT support."
"Amazon" "Love it"
"Amazon" "Verizon employee at corporate store stated the phone was not compatible when I brought it in for activation and they scanned the model code on the back.  However, when they tried taking the SIM card from my Droid Razr Maxx and plugged it in, it worked like a charm on Verizon network.  Have been using it for days and love it.  Strongly recommend a case for protection."
"Amazon" "Despite reviews, the camera is not very good. Specifically, the native dynamic range is very limited, and the HDR feature seems to be faked in software (with poor results) as opposed to \"real\" HDR where multiple images are captured at different exposures and blended together into one.When shooting at night, areas around light bulbs are bleached. When shooting during the day in contrasty scenes, the blue sky is bleached white, even with the HDR mode on.My 2014 iPhone 6 plus does not have a problem capturing the dynamic range of these scenes without bleaching, and takes much better overall pictures (despite the lower pixel count) because it has real HDR that works well.I even tried a 3rd party true HDR camera app. But, in the darkest exposure setting the areas around light bulbs at night are bleached. Basically, the camera's hardware just doesn't have the range to do it.Also, the camera has awful halo effects at night, regardless of whether I use the stock camera app or the paid premium one. Streetlights, etc. have horizontal lines that run across the screen from end to end.I am thinking of getting rid of this brand new phone because the camera is so sub-par compared to my past iPhones. In fact, my iPhone 4S has a preferable camera in some ways because it does HDR properly.The 1080p video is also inferior to my 2014 iPhone 6 plus. There is a notable lack of detail and contrast in the videos. While it is encoded as 1080p, apparently due to compression artifacts or whatnot, there is a notable loss of detail that makes the result look like a good 480p shoot.And the audio for video, while fairly good, is also inferior to the 2014 Apple model. This is quite apparent when shooting at a concert.And, the S8 chews through battery rapidly, even with almost all app push notifications and auto updates turned off, and even with the phone in the middle battery saving mode with the processor and display throttled back. I couldn't get through a day in an amusement park without running out of battery.Lastly, while the OLED screen has stunning brightness and color gamut, the color accuracy is notably off. I found this to be occasionally irritating when watching movies, and it prevented me from accurately adjusting photos with photo editing apps.The phone is quite nice looking, and the iris scanner works better than I expected. The front facing camera the best I've yet seen. The cellular reception is slightly better than my old phone - i will get 1 bar in some places where I used to get \"no service.\"Good phone all in all, but the camera flaws are a dealbreaker for me."
"Amazon" "There is paint chipping off the bottom two corners. Looks like I'm sending it in."
"Amazon" "Amazing. I never get the wireless charger but the phone and the oculus are great. The best phone is no doubt."
"Amazon" "As an continuing Samsung customer, I have always been treated well by the devices I've bought. The S8 is a beautiful piece of work that I've become attached to and it is the best mobile device I've owned this far!"
"Amazon" "Earlier this year someone made fun of my old S3. I guess that was sticking around in my head because inexplicably I bought an S8 during the prime day sale. After having the phone for a while I'm ready to say a few things about it.Are any of the flagship phones worth the price?No.No phone is worth this price. For the cost of the S8 I could have replaced my aging laptop.Is this a nice phone? Sure. The screen seems to gather fingerprints more than my old S3, but aside from that I don't have any complaints off the top of my head. The major problem I've already stated. The value of a flag ship phone is far below the retail price. Don't be like me. If you're not actually in high school you're fast running out of excuses for succumbing to peer pressure. None of us need $500-700 phones and there's plenty of other crap to be spending our money on."
"Amazon" "Phone come in a really good condition and works perfect"
"Amazon" "Phone works great but having problems with the sim card. Says the carrier is sprint but I cant use TextNow (who is a branch of sprint.) Only buy if youre in for some carrier problems."
"Amazon" "Phone features are good but durability is horrendous. Glass is way too fragile! Phone fell on carpet (with case) and screen cracked. This is my forth  Samsung S5, S6, S7 & S8 and the others held up well.  Consider the cost to repair and or insurance + cost of phone! Very disappointing."
"Amazon" "Not happy with this phone. The incoming/outgoing calls have issues. Any call after 2 mins the audio is gone. The other person cannot hear me but i can hear them. Please do not buy this version of the phone. Waste of money. Googled and found that there are lot of people going thru this issue without  a fix. Need to call amazon about returning."
"Amazon" "Perfect. Great phone at a great price. My unit was brand new, sealed with everything you'd expect. Also unlocked (and doesn't lock to the first Sim) this really is a great deal."
"Amazon" "Received quickly, phone activated with no issues on Sprint network since I had ordered the SIM at the same time. Beautiful phone!"
"Amazon" "Really nice phone i have dropped twice without cover  while i was waiting for my cover and has had no damage. Plus really nice camara default down fault censor botton is net to camara but i will get use to it"
"Amazon" "Absolutely love this phone just received it yesterday. I am still exploring it is sleek fast,love the camera features very easy to transfer files to old phone to this one..No problems activating the device"
"Amazon" "I bought this for my fiancé. I’m a iPhoneUser and I’m so jealous. Amazing phone. Highly recomend ti."
"Amazon" "Husband loves it.  He has had it for months now and it works great."
"Amazon" "It's a great phone, marvelous design and fast. Been almosto two weeks with it and is really great, only complain is the location of the fingerpprint reader, I guess for the S9 will fix the location."
"Amazon" "The best phone I have ever used... great battery life... beautiful screen just love my s8 plus.... only  thing is have to keep it fragile as the body is all beautiful  glass.. rest everything is deluce"
"Amazon" "You'll probably have to activate it yourself because Verizon personnel seem to be ignorant about what to do with these.  Luckily it is very easy to do. Love, love, love this phone."
"Amazon" "Again, Samsung impresses. It has great visuals and a very sleek design. There is plenty of space for selfies and all of the apps you like (e.g. Snapchat, Amazon, and Instagram). It is at such an unbelievably low price, too. This is the newest Samsung Phone, an that shows."
"Amazon" "I was worried if it would be usable for me living in Japan, but I was able to easily get a sim card for it and it works well. It is what it said it would be so I am satisfied."
"Amazon" "One of the best phones. I have been with Iphone for more than 5 years and never tried an android phone. Thanks to the campaign as i have opted to try it for the first time and i am loving it. The biggest positive for the phone is its display. Even Camera is very good. I feel they went totally wrong with the fingerprint sensor placement. Design of the phone is great."
"Amazon" "Excellent product.I come from Xperia smartphones, this is my first galaxy and truly it's the best, It's worth.Package arrived in time and with all the stuffs (quick charger, usb cable, earphones (not the best).Highly recommended, with quick charge you can charge it at 100 percent in aprox 1 hour."
"Amazon" "works better than anything I've seen \"GREAT\" phone"
"Amazon" "Much better than IPhone. In this moment this is absolutely best smartphone with amazing display and proper size."
"Amazon" "I had a galaxy 4 and was due for an upgrade.  It needed a new battery too. So decided to get an 8 plus. There are more days than not that I think I should get a new battery for my 4 and use that. I do like some of the upgrades from the 4, love love love the camera but this phone can have a mind of its own."
"Amazon" "Great phone."
"Amazon" "Love the display and the way it feels in my hand, glad I got the plus version."
"Amazon" "Slow charging / please use original charger messages appear when plugged in."
"Amazon" "So upset i receive the package with things i never order. So i order this galaxy s8 phone i order a case and a screen protector NONE of those item i got in the box when it arrived i open the box and it had random things that i never ordered and NO PHONE!!!!!just an empty box"
"Amazon" "Absolutely loving my galaxy!!! It's fast, and very convenient. Beautiful display and great graphics."
"Amazon" "I’ll keep my iPhone but it’s ok I guess."
"Amazon" "A very nice phone"
"Amazon" "Amazing phone easily connected to T-Mobile, with a little muscle memory the fingerprint reader gets easier to access, the adapters at amazing though, even supporting a mouse yeah a mouse:). Bixby is cumbersome but she can be helpful, especially for reminders."
"Amazon" "Great phone and everything I researched was included. Great packaging and speedy delivery. Only problem was that my landscape mode and heartbeat sensor doesn't work at all. Not a deal breaker but still, you want top notch for your money. Will continue to search for solutions but otherwise a great phone."
"Amazon" "It's not that great of a phone. It doesn't come in white. It's curved on the edges so finding a screen protector that doesn't collect lint on the edges under the protector. I can't wait to trade it in later it sucks."
"Amazon" "Great phone. Seller should specify exact model number. Mine is SM-G950U1"
"Amazon" "Awesome phone. Works great on my Verizon network. Had to buy a Verizon nano sim card and activated the phone from myverizon website."
"Amazon" "I upgraded from a galaxy mega 2 to the galaxy S8 plus. And this phone is amazing. Amazon got it here in less than 48 hours and the price was right! Thanks Amazon"
"Amazon" "The phone was sold to me as 'new' but it experienced Black Screen of Death from which I was not able to recover immediately after installing."
"Amazon" "Great phone, feels great in the hand, Bluetooth 5.0, and finger print sensor works great! Takes about 4 hours to get use to it being on the back"
"Amazon" "The Phone is amazing. Highly recommend to anyone considering in purchasing this phone."
"Amazon" "After great experiences with my s4 & Note 4 i couldn't pass up the Prime day deal on the S8. The camera is crazy and the phone itself is solid as a brick (and looks  good just sitting there). Nougat and Bixby take some getting used to (I haven't given up and resorted to a custom launcher yet). You can't customize LED colors for different apps/callers. There's still one tiny speaker instead of adopting stereo speakers like other companies. But my biggest complaint is the Bluetooth is Fubar. The forums are full of people that can't get this series phone to sync with radios or speakers. I've tried three cars and two speakers and the only thing it successfully pairs with is the controller for the VR headset. Thankfully my Note4 works just fine for mobile entertainment, but I can't use my car's hands-free calling features.It's a fine phone, Still has a headphone jack...which apparently I'll need for music since the Bluetooth doesn't work right, but is missing stuff that should have been caught before shipping."
"Amazon" "Still learning how to use it."
"Amazon" "Best phone for current era. It would have been more good, if it supports dual sim option like international version."
"Amazon" "Great price for a used S8!"
"Amazon" "Love the phone. My only complaint would be that the charger it came with died within 5 days.  :("
"Amazon" "good phone"
"Amazon" "Happy !!!"
"Amazon" "This is am an awesome phone. Look at all the features it as and the 64GB never have to worry about storage.It like everything you want to pack into this device. I love the features and the phone itself. Samsung did a great job creating a phone like this."
"Amazon" "Great product at a great price during Black Friday, and was able to use my Citi points.It looks and feels small, but the display is amazing.I also bought Maxboost Galaxy S8 Case mSnap and the ArmorSuit - Galaxy S8 MilitaryShield and both work perfect for the phone."
"Amazon" "Too expensive but cheaper than an iPhone and just as functional."
"Amazon" "The king is here. Prepare your ass- be whooped, Apple!"
"Amazon" "Great experience, will buy from this seller again!"
"Amazon" "Excellent!!!"
"Amazon" "Love It ! !"
"Amazon" "Well, its Galaxy S8. Check out the reviews online. No complains. Cool device."
"Amazon" "Still loving it!"
"Amazon" "Amazing!!! Top of the league cell phone. What a beast!"
"Amazon" "I love it.  It's a decent step up from my previous Galaxy (S6 Edge Plus).  The placement of the fingerprint scanner is my only gripe (next to the camera lens... really?) but the awesome retina scanner makes up for it.  I've read some say the retina scanner \"takes too long\", but mine unlocks consistently in under a second.This is a deceptively tough phone, but you'll want a case as it's pretty darn sleek."
"Amazon" "scratches easily"
"Amazon" "sadly, this is one of the worst smartphones i ever owned. I am especially disappointed with the camera which is atrocious. All pictures and video are so noisy and low quality is ridiculous. For a phone this price it's unacceptable. I owned a Galaxy S5 previously, and its camera is so superior to the one on this phone."
"Amazon" "Im very disappointed with my purchase, i purchase this phone in August and the phone no longer turns on as of November 27 this year."
"Amazon" "Very nice.So far so good."
"Amazon" "Got the phone for 550 which is a steal at this price"
"Amazon" "Nice Improvement over S7"
"Amazon" "If there's a negative zero i will choose that for this item.I trusted Amazon LLC to be selling efficient devices and I was wrong.It's hardly 3 months since I purchased this item and its not working.i could hardly hear people I am talking to on the phone so i had to use a speaker to hear them.so you can't afford to have a private conversation.I emailed amazon about the issue and because its way pass the return period they didn't help.Warning to those purchasing this item think a million times don't waste your money.Think where its safer to buy cellphones.I believe in Karma what goes around will come around."
"Amazon" "For some reason, my phone comes not sealed or anything. Furthermore, the edge screen isn't responsive at times."
"Amazon" "Great deal, Verizon will act stupid when you try to switch your phone. They will assume it is a prepaid, just tell Verizon to shut up and put a sim card in it. Very happy with this deal!"
"Amazon" "love it"
"Amazon" "I liked the last version of this phone better. The S8 is glitchy. Bixby is annoying. The autocorrect seems dumber than The old AI. The curved edges mess with the touch screen. The camera is a little better, but it doesn't make up for the overall poor performance. Not impressed at all."
"Amazon" "Why was I so loyal to the iPhone for so long?  The Galaxy makes the iPhone look like a toy that you would give to a small child to keep them busy.  I love this phone...  Every aspect of it blows Apple away...  I even went to the Apple store to check out the iPhone X - side by side the Galaxy still looks 10 times better..  I love it.  Customization...  Removable memory.  The best phone on the planet."
"Amazon" "Battery sucks, you have to turn on the battery saver to survive a day. 'OK google' not working in this phone. Bixby is worst"
"Amazon" "I've had this phone for a week now and it's been a great experience! Phone runs smooth and looks great! I've had a case on it the whole time and it continues to be a good experience. Will update after more time with it."
"Amazon" "I didn't get the headphones, the right charger and only 1 adapted and there was a slight scratch on the glass. YES, on the GLASS of the screen. Yes I purchased as Used GOOD but this was less than good and for $550, that's still a lot of money. Very disappointed. It states original packaging but may be damaged, did not say missing parts."
"Amazon" "I am loving this phone, still learning new features everyday.  Loved that it was delivered on time."
"Amazon" "very good phone,i like it soo much, ty Samsung and Amazon.com LLC;)"
"Amazon" "Exelente"
"Amazon" "I love the phone but i think i got one with a defect, it randomly freezes and turns off"
"Amazon" "It's a nice phone only problem I have is the HD Voice, WiFi Calling, and VoLTE(Voice over LTE) (the feature that allows you to use data and Voice at the same time doesn't work) but I love it I'm hoping this will change when I receive my replacement unit but I love it! And I love Amazon! They have really impressed me! Kudos to Samsung and Amazon!"
"Amazon" "Well, screen cracked with just one week and a half old. Just one fall. Unable to use it anymore. I feel disappointed and angry about how cellphone business has become. Sell fragile devices and charge a fortune for a replacement. Around $300, because basically the phone is a single unit, so they have to change almost everything, even the battery (because of their exploding batteries history, they must replace it) You get what you pay for? doesn't apply here."
"Amazon" "Worth every penny."
"Amazon" "I love my new phone.  My first upgrade in years."
"Amazon" "Samsung and Google are competing on my phone on whose software to use.  I LOVED my S5 so easy to use but now every little thing is a chore.  I have to decide to use Samsung or Google software for everything!  I wish I had known Samsung decided on this version to become more of a software company and push more than the last few phones to dominate over Google.  The phone itself is beautiful."
"Amazon" "Couldn't be better.  :-)"
"Amazon" "Looks brand new, works perfectly"
"Amazon" "This phone is the best android phone I have ever used. Totally worth it for the price."
"Amazon" "Fantastic phone so far, hope it will last me many years."
"Amazon" "Best damn phone ever invented."
"Amazon" "I'm not sure if I can get used to this phone coming from a Nexus 6. Since it's a 5.8\" screen and Nexus 6 is 5.9\", I didn't expect there to be a huge difference. But there is. It's so super narrow it's about the same width as a normal ratio 5\" phone. It appears much smaller in person than I expected when I ordered it.That I may be able to adapt to. It's the curved edges that are horrible. Not only do they make it appear even more narrow, but things on the edge are slightly distorted and the color is off unless you look at it dead on, and even then I can see a bit of distortion and discoloration on the curved edges. At an angle it's unbearable the way the edges are darker than the rest of the screen. It's especially noticeable when the screen is a solid light color, with the edges having a blue tint.This alone is a deal breaker for me. It's hard to look at. If it was a flat, even surface it would be so much better. I don't predict this gimmick catching on. At least I hope it doesn't."
"Amazon" "Great phone and an amazing unboxing experience. Phone came fast and it's truly 100% factory unlocked."
"Amazon" "Excellent"
"Amazon" "Very happy."
"Amazon" "Great phone with a stunning edge to edge display that allows users to immerse themselves in video and gaming content. Although being an iOS user it was difficult to have apps from android not match the extent of options I am used to. The only other issue is if you have hands that can not reach the finger print sensor. But, all in all a great phone if you are able to move to the android ecosystem. Probably the best android phones out there!"
"Amazon" "If you like to be surprised several times every day by your phone doing something different, this is the phone for you!!!I do like the hardware.TERRIBLE software! There are layers and layers and needless, annoying complexity that I don't want or need. The worst thing about this phone is it is UNPREDICTABLE. Today I COULD NOT answer an incoming call even though the phone was in my hand! I had been browsing the Internet on Chrome and could HEAR the ring  but NO INTERFACE to answer. A day or two ago I got no interface to shut off the LOOKOUT scream feature. Sometimes I get the proper interface, other times not! Full of surprises!Bixby is useless and annoying as well, and so is the \"battery charging\" screen. Getting into the phone is a hassle most of the time. Sometimes you have to do your pattern, then swipe past a screen or two then do you pattern AGAIN. Why? Who knows. Next time it might be different!Samsung should stick to HARDWARE and let GOOGLE do the software. Give people ANDROID STOCK phones and stop trying to compete with your own partner. Please! PLEASE!!! If Samsung didn't waste money paying designers and developers to add GARBAGE that degrades they phone, it would probably be better AND cheaper.I think letting you answer calls is JOB ONE for a PHONE.Mine fails that most basic task...sometimes...because it is clogged with a bunch of kludgy garbage software. Very disappointed."
"Amazon" "Just great. Worth the money."
"Amazon" "I love it <3"
"Amazon" "I love this phone, when I say Love. I love this phone! Its awesome, it came with everything included in the box and was easy to set up with the phone company of my choice."
"Amazon" "HiI was buying clean phone ,But I got previous verizon phone .The phone is not compatible with T-Mobile.When I returned the phone I needed also to pay for return .In general I wasted my time and also my money.Very unhappy."
"Amazon" "love the phone,deviled fast  just love it"
"Amazon" "The phone is a great phone, I love everything about it."
"Amazon" "Nice cellphone, nice vendor"
"Amazon" "0 stars. This is the rube goldberg of cell phones. Idk who is giving this phone more than 1 star other than because you have to give at least one. Everything wrong with this phone in a nutshell- bixby button, misplaced fingerprint scanner, misplaced speaker, annoying side tab on edge of screen- oh and it's really expensive. I promise you will not like this phone- unless you drive slow in the passing lane."
"Amazon" "Had it in my pants pocket and screen scratched after two days.  Never put it into anywhere else that would be endanger it.  There was nothing in the pocket too!!! My friend dropped it from the couch to carpet and it shattered as well. Too bad because the software and camera are great. Cannot recommend this phone."
"Amazon" "good good good"
"Amazon" "Fast shipping, and everything arrived in perfect condition. I absolutely love the phone and would recommend this product to anyone."
"Amazon" "I Love it! Best looking phone I have ever had."
"Amazon" "Best phone ever purchased. Worth the money."
"Amazon" "The phone is awesome, super fast and, very easy to use."
"Amazon" "Great product and everything was the same as published"
"Amazon" "Love this phone."
"Amazon" "excellent product and great seller!!!!!"
"Amazon" "Amazing! This phone looks beautiful. Software wise, it's okay, get a different launcher if you want."
"Amazon" "Amazing phone,  came two weeks early in Australia I'm very happy"
"Amazon" "Amazing phone. I was so scared that it will be fake or something else because i read the comments. But it is not fake it runs amazing. Best phone ever. I definitely recommend it."
"Amazon" "Such a wonderful device."
"Amazon" "Still on Android 7.0 (Sep 01 2017). Completely outdated firmware, a lot of bloatware on device. Very unfortunate upgrade policy. Great hardware, but software / firmware sucks. Never again Samsung, just very much behind."
"Amazon" "Pretty nice device. Strongly recommendation!"
"Amazon" "good product."
"Amazon" "Performance is great. The display and the camera need special mention here. So, does Bixby button - it is a ergonomic nightmare and absolutely useless."
"Amazon" "Best smartphone ever."
"Amazon" "Excelente producto."
"Amazon" "This is possibly the best phone I have ver owned. The display is brilliant, camera is superb and at sub 580$ this is a steal of a deal for this devise. Definitely a must buy."
"Amazon" "Very dissapointed, after 2 days, the  gorilla glass just got a scratch..., it s a shame for this gorilla glass , even my galaxy s4  has less scratch than this s8 got in 2 days of using.The product was good, but i am dissapointed about the gorilla glass"
"Amazon" "Upgrade from iP6 to ss8 plus now. Very incredible production. It works with GSM carrier. Fast shipping and good customer service. 5 stars!"
"Amazon" "Phone is amazing,nothing more to add that is allready not posted.For now all perfect!"
"Amazon" "Everything ok!"
"Amazon" "Love it. Works beautifully."
"Amazon" "Excellent smartphone!!!"
"Amazon" "The best phone ive owned"
"Amazon" "very good and classy"
"Amazon" "I love the galaxies, now I want to buy both 8+ and 8 but I don't want the dual SIM cos that's what we have in Nigeria.  Though I want to use them in Nigeria."
"Amazon" "Is good phone"
"Amazon" "Just amazing"
"Amazon" "Love the phone"
"Amazon" "Muy bueno !!!"
"Amazon" "The phone arrived in perfect condtion. The phone works nice and smooth. I was able to transfer my service to this phone with no problems. I am using metropcs"
"Amazon" "Excellent!!!"
"Amazon" "Its awesome."
"Amazon" "The \"fast charger\" charges very slow. My old S6 charges faster than this. Also the headphone quality is very low. It cuts off if you move it a certain way. Other than that the phone works very well."
"Amazon" "I installed two of these; one went on great, the other not so great.  one is curled up a little at the bottom.  This occurred when I put the protective case back on the phone.  The material is durable and the curled portion does not affect the function, just the appearance."
"Amazon" "I love this phhone.It works perfectly on both my local service provider here in the bahamas."
"Amazon" "Until now is working well, it has a nice screen."
"Amazon" "Well of course it's Awesome, it's a Galaxy S8 !Great phone , had no problems getting it hooked up with AT&T."
"Amazon" "I've had my galaxy s8 plus for about six months now and really love it. The newest IPhone doesn't compare to this android."
"Amazon" "I enjoy the S8 - it's sleek, got a large screen, and large numbers for my fat fingers to type on.  I'm still a terrible texter, but at least I'm LESS terrible on this slightly wider screen.  Bixby does get annoying - lord knows I yell at it every time I accidentally hit the Bixby button on the side, but I do love this phone."
"Amazon" "The screen cracks easily  and you will be out $700+ dollars (not covered in manufacturer's warranty).  You don't need to drop the phone to crack the screen.This is a warning, Google \"Samsung Galaxy S8\" and screen and see what you come up with.If Samsung doesn't issue a recall, there may soon be a class action lawsuit."
"Amazon" "Bought this for my wife to replace her S5. She likes it. She's happy."
"Amazon" "Very nice smartphone!!! The photos are wonderful! Fotos muito boas e aparelho fenomenal!"
"Amazon" "Best phone I have every had."
"Amazon" "Disappointing.  I was looking forward to upgrading from Note 4 to 8.  Once I saw/held the 8, I decided to stick with the 4.  The 8 is too long and skinny making it inconvenient to read on, it breaks to easily and is slips out of the hand easier.  By now, all phones should be stronger/more impact resistant for dropping without a case.  Hopefully the Note 9 will be better meaning shorter, wider and stronger."
"Amazon" "Yes works with Verizon wireless!"
"Amazon" "Great phone. I love everything about it"
"Amazon" "Arrived in great condition. No complaints whatsoever. Just make sure to buy a cover. Phone is very sensitive to falling."
"Amazon" "Love the s8 phone itself.  I had destroyed my first one and bought this one to replace it. I have Verizon wireless as my carrier. So i got this unlocked one. You loose some Verizon features like visual voice mails that I did not realize upon buying. But now after a month of use the Wi-Fi stopped work. Shows it's connected  until you try and load a webpage or use an app the Wi-Fi crashes and has to restart and connect.  Will continue to do so and the page will not load till you turn Wi-Fi off. Leaving me pretty dissatisfied with a 1 month old phone."
"Amazon" "Best phone ever."
"Amazon" "First off I thought it was weird that the box felt light. So I opened it and the packing for the actual phone was all beat up.  And guess what, it was completely empty. There was absolutely nothing in the packaging where the phone was supposed to be. Papers and all. I am highly pissed. Never ordering again."
"Amazon" "I did not buy through Amazon, but this is by far the most reliable phone on the market."
"Amazon" "Unlocked S8 will not fully work on ATT / Verizon.  These features are blocked:  HD Voice, video calling, volte, and wifi calling features"
"Amazon" "So many bugs on my phone.Everytime I lock the home bar below it unlocks itself after a few days.Besides that this is the first galaxy I've had that's tripping balls in the software for many things."
"Amazon" "I love the Samsung galaxy s8! That I know of, Amazon was the only place that offered some sort of black Friday deal that didn't involve signing a contract. I hmam extremely happy with my purchase!!"
"Amazon" "nice"
"Amazon" "Love the S8, and shipping here was fast."
"Amazon" "This is really a great phone, there's not 1 thing I don't like!"
"Amazon" "came quickly and works great.  exactly as advertised"
"Amazon" "My new phone is BEAUTIFUL and Verizon set it up for free. FYI at Verizon this phone is $970+!!!! The Amazon."
"Amazon" "Hi a have a huge audience on social media and YouTube. I would love to review and promote this product! Get back to me."
"Amazon" "Would give 0 if I could!  Received phone, all it does is reboot constantly, before I was able to even set it up!  Cannot get past wifi screen without it rebooting.  Samsung is of no help.  Reading online, this issue has existed for 8 months and they are still shipping defective phones without a fix.  I will be returning this POS, and will get an iPhone instead.  Shame on you Samsung!"
"Amazon" "1 month into using this phone it stopped working on its own."
"Amazon" "This product was as described in perfect condition and works perfectly."
"Amazon" "Happy with the choice of phone and it great one to have."
"Amazon" "Love the phone or shipped fast and a great phone switched from iPhone and would never turn back"
"Amazon" "Lots of great new features.  Slimmer."
"Amazon" "Awesome phone love the price"
"Amazon" "Very good"
"Amazon" "AMAZING phone.  Looks so good and functionality is seamless"
"Amazon" "Great phone!"
"Amazon" "Yes everything I expected and more"
"Amazon" "Just as described!"
"Amazon" "Just an average phone. The selling point being that it's an \"edge\" is kinda pointless being that most cases cover up around the edges. Gets in the way of some video formats, covering the bar. And the screen protector helps but because of the \"Edge\" it leaves the sides exposed. Now the case will cover it as I said, however it will also slowly peel the Screen protector off. And believe me you are gonna need that case. All the protection you can get. Had a foot drop, not only do I have a cracked screen but an actual hole. Waterproof selling point out the window. With such a high maintenance phone, idk why you would have it near water in the first place. Had this for a few weeks, battery was great until recently,  drains more quickly now. Damn ridiculous. (Update: beside battery continues to diminish it total life span, now having trouble shooting and storing photos. They become corrupted) I'm done with this phone, should of given LG a chance."
"Amazon" "I am disappointed, Is it unlocked ? Because it doesn't really work as a phone. I mean it's main function is to call,  but it doesn't see my sim card, I have no network connection, even though it was set up to the carrier instructions. My other phone works fine with the same settings and simcard."
"Amazon" "Love my S8! Awesome screen and takes great pictures!"
"Amazon" "I like it. Good cellphone. No problem"
"Amazon" "The S8 is too small I like to return it and get the 8 plus is that possible"
"Amazon" "It wasn't for Verizon phones they said it  is for GSM carriers only, not CDMA, it will not work with Verizon. It will work with any global GSM mobile service provider such as T-mobile, ATT, etc. So either I have to switch cell users or return the phone.  I haven't decided yet."
"Amazon" "unable to get cameras to work little help from ZOSI teck"
"Amazon" "Mostly good"
"Amazon" "I love this cellphone."
"Amazon" "samsung software is awful and intrusivebixby sucksfingerprint scanner sucksheadphones sucksave yourself the trouble and get an LG"
"Amazon" "Came with a stuck pixel in the left-center of the screen. It's extremely annoying and i've requested a replacement."
"Amazon" "I love this phone...."
"Amazon" "Returned it because it doesn't have wifi calling and that's the only reason I bought it. It's a great phone just spend the extra money at the carrier's store and wifi calling works."
"Amazon" "Excelent product. I am ALWAYS buying from Amazon. 100% recommended"
"Amazon" "Great phone.  Many upgrades from my previous phone!"
"Amazon" "It's great, gotta get usr yo having no home button but it's great"
"Amazon" "This phone is a beast!"
"Amazon" "DOES NOT WORK WITH BOOST MOBILE. DO NOT PURCHASE OF YOU ARE A BOOST CUSTOMER YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ACTIVATE IT."
"Amazon" "Love my new phone!!!"
"Amazon" "Samsung Galaxy 8 is the best phone on the market.  I love it!"
"Amazon" "Bought at Sam's Club. 17 days after owning the phone it would no longer charge at the port. There was  defect in the connection. I contacted the company.  They had me send in the phone for repair.  Eleven days later (yesterday) I got my phone back. Charging port worked fine, but then the phone kept shutting down and restarting. I couldn't even get it to stay on long enough to set it up. I contacted the company again and I have sent off the phone again for repairs. Where the phone is barely used I wish they would just replace it so that I could have an experience without a defective phone.  I spent a lot of money on this phone.  The phone is beautiful in design, but I was not going for beauty, just reliability, and it failed, miserably.  Because of this experience with the phone and customer service, this is, most likely, my last Samsung phone purchase. If you buy this phone, you'll need the warranty. Unfortunately,  I didn't buy the warranty. I had already paid more than intended for the phone. I didn't have the funds for the warranty."
"Amazon" "Great product,but my older one  Sam. 5 one picked whi fi a lot, this needs a much stronger signl,  darn!"
"Amazon" "I love it"
"Amazon" "Very cool phone! Ultra beautiful I think"
"Amazon" "First foray into Android and got it to go with a Samsung Gear S3 smartwatch.  I'm very happy with both."
"Amazon" "1rst and biggest, you have to get a case. This phone is so slippery it's silly. I set it on a pillow the other morning it would not stay.  gravity slowly Slid it off. I've dropped this 600$ phone twice in less than a week. It has rounded/tappered edges hardly any bezel to get a purchase on. Yes this is normally a good thing, but dropping sucks.2nd finger print sensor is in a poorly thought out spot next to camera lens. It's hard to say where to place it because it feels natural where they put it. Maybe move camera, Regardless your camera lens Will be smudged.3rd bixby not interested in it and I don't have a choice. The dedicated button is in the worst spot.  If I hold phone in landscape to take pic, watch video, or what ever I hit the button (by the way I'm left handed) with thumb. Phone is so slick holding in landscape position is precarious already. Samsung and bloatware, bixby is to much and to dedicate an annoying button to it is absolutely dumb.4th the screen is curved on edges and can be touched or tapped. I have big hands, phone is slick, phone is thin, and edges are round so i try to grip it good especially in landscape. Watching a YouTube video as an example either I hit bixby button or  accidently hit top left corner  of screen dropping notifications bar down or in YouTube back video up 10 seconds(how i am double tapping is beyond me). I have ordered a case it's been a week waiting on shipping I hope this fixes most of these problems. Being one of the more expensive phones out there, You would think these things would be thought through.5th I liked having removable battery option but LG doesn't offer any more. So I am assuming no decent smart phone has that option anymore. But on average I get a new phone every 2-3 years and generally battery would be replaced once in that time. 600$-700$ it should last that long. Seems to be a rant but for the money it should be better. And for god sakes stop with the bloatware, and a dedicated physical button. Seems like your are trying to piss off customers."
"Amazon" "Can I leave a negative review? Gorilla glass doesn't protect from shattering your screen. It's marketing B.S.. my phone is shattered!!!!"
"Amazon" "My husband got this for himself and took it to the Verizon store and had them sit it up."
"Amazon" "Great phone !"
"Amazon" "Assigned this as a work phone.  I am already seeking to buy my own phone and move the sim as I type this.  Who thought beveled edges were a good idea?"
"Amazon" "Love this phone best phone i had"
"Amazon" "It's amazing this phone"
"Amazon" "aaaaa+++++!!!"
"Amazon" "Perfect"
"Amazon" "Love my new phone. It is taking me a while to learn to navigate everything on it."
"Amazon" "Very good very good"
"Amazon" "Charging problems within 2weeks of use. Frustrating to say the least."
"Amazon" "california4asasdszgfgfg"
"Amazon" "Love Samsung products! This is my 3rd android from Samsung, and each upgrade just keeps getting better. Good price, too!"
"Amazon" "Great product"
"Amazon" "Boss!!!"
"Amazon" "Great phone, amazing display. Sometimes I’ve lags, but without influence on performance."
"Amazon" "Good"
"Amazon" "I hate Bixby. Samsung please disable Bixby. The phone is a piece of glass. Buy the case before you buy the phone. Otherwise it's a great phone."
"Amazon" "DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT FROM AMAZON, THEY DO NOT STAND BEHIND ANY WARRANTIES AND POCKET REPLACEMENTS."
"Amazon" "I did not buy for myself.  Getting early presents done."
"Amazon" "The phone is amazing rather for some rattling that happens when you shake it. The headphones broke shortly after a day of use which is bad specially for $100 headphones, didn't do anything to them, just normal use and they broke."
"Amazon" "Fairly certain this phone was opened before reaching me. There was no film on it, ear buds were missing, SIM card release pin was missing, and phone was completely dead. It seems like a new phone so I'm sticking with it, but it I think someone took it out of the box, and used it for a time. It explains all of those things. Especially the pin, which should be in a box with the documentation. All the reading material as there, the sheet with the pin on it was missing."
"Amazon" "Good phone. Nice camera and the screen is good. I hate the wrap-around screen, though. Does nothing for me as a feature, and it makes it hard to get an effective case. My screen protector doesn't work well with the case, either. Definitely going to get something with a flat screen next time I get a phone. Sad, too, because I've really liked my Samsung phones, otherwise. Really like the alarm app."
"Amazon" "Great phone which is to be expected with a Samsung product. No complaints."
"Amazon" "Shipping was dismal. But the phone was as advertised and we'll boxed with all the proper items. Would definitely buy this again."
"Amazon" "It's a good thing to use"
"Amazon" "grate phone, excellent display"
"Amazon" "This is the best and most beautiful phone I've had. Hands down a sight of beauty."
"Amazon" "Excellent phone.  The only three things keeping me from giving this a 5 star rating are:1) No replaceable battery.  If the phone locks up you have to hope holding down the down and power buttons will interrupt the phone and force a reset.  Also, when the battery will no longer hold a charge you are SOL (And this will happen sooner or later...it will force you to buy a new expensive phone even if a new battery would fix the issue at a much reduced cost).2) Bixby...just plain annoying!  The button is in an awkward location and when you hold the phone horizontally it causes Bixby to turn on unless you stretch your hand/fingers into awkward locations.3) Curved glass.  While this looks sleek and \"sexy\" it is kinda annoying.  If somebody is standing anywhere near you they can see what is going on on your phone.  Also makes screen protectors a lot more expensive and elaborate.Can't argue much with the price though, much cheaper here on Amazon than anywhere else."
"Amazon" "This phone is amazing and for the price that I got it here is even movers amazing. It literally cost almost $200 dollars less than in Samsung's website (that was by the time that I bought it, it might not be true now, stuff change price all the time.)"
"Amazon" "love love love my phone!"
"Amazon" "buyer be ware  they don't disclose that this unlocked version will not work with some of the Verizon apps  I spent 2 hours on the phone with Verizon tech support before they figured out it was a universal phone that didn't have all the capabilities to utilize Verizon apps  I will never buy another phone from here  it was an expencive lesson learned"
"Amazon" "Black screen on arrival. Black screen. Charge works, the \"accessibility\" voice talks. But no screen at all. So disappointed!"
"Amazon" "Great. Best choice."
"Amazon" "It was a good phone but my wife needed bigger screen."
"Amazon" "So far so good. Mom's enjoying her phone and have not reported any issues."
"Amazon" "Absolutely gorgeous phone and display. Gorilla glass screen being indestructible is a joke. It's the most fragile smartphone I've ever owned. Extremelt disappointed with all aspects of Samsung customer servive."
"Amazon" "Very nice 👍🏽"
"Amazon" "The phone is good and I got a 120 down. I would like to buy one more for my other daughters."
"Amazon" "If you have Verizon, don't expect to be able to use wi-fi calling.  :-("
"Amazon" "Nice phone"
"Amazon" "Excellent phone with incredible battery and it's extremely fast. It comes without all of the carrier bloatware and you still get 90% of all the features. Worked perfectly by just inserting my Verizon sim card from previous phone without having to go into the store."
"Amazon" "New phone came in nicely packed, with everything included and the phone itself is really good"
"Amazon" "I'm in love of these phone."
"Amazon" "My faith in Samsung is going down the drain. We've used Samsung forever. But when my hubby's s8 plus screen cracks when it falls in the couch, and my s8 plus screen cracked because the tip of my hairspray bottle barely landed on it, you gotta wonder.  Why such fragile phones.  And no warranty to cover such incidents. Not like we dropped them on the ground."
"Amazon" "Not a good choice. Should have paid the money from Verizon. Emails, calls, messages take days to get and I live in the city. No notification for voicemail built in. Would not buy again."
"Amazon" "Very good"
"Amazon" "Just hope you never have a problem. Fragile, and absolutely horrible customer support. And  I mean horrible..... Samsung refuses to honor warranty claim. Keep sending this piece of junk S8 back to me. Actually 3 times. They keep apologizing. And issuing a new RMA And then after a week return to me..... What a joke. Do not waste your time or money on this phone or this company. I will never by a Samsung product again. Not recommended ever....."
"Amazon" "Excelente telefono"
"Amazon" "Love it"
"Amazon" "ordered this phone and its so great!!! came in its samsung box with everything new condition and was able to connect it to verizon which was great!!"
"Amazon" "complete overrated junk like all new phones made to break and keep you brain dead. why do i hate this phone well let me see...lets start with its shuts of then never turns back on complete crash no reboot tricks nothing absolutely nothing for no reason other then to make you lose time and money on top of what they robbed you for the phone. if it i could do it all over id shove it up samsungs azz they cant do anything right setting homes and airplanes on fire for 800 bucks you get a hunk of useless plastic and painted glass. then when you call for help on your out of the box phone they pretend they dont know about a well known issue just to bust your balls a little more send it in and get back in 2 weeks? how about you send a new oine and i send you a 2500.00 bill for lost wage and customers. thankfully sprint crooks are sending a replacment because samsung doesnt stand by there junk products i wouldnt by a bouncy ball with samsungs name on it. im gonna sell this phone to some retard that thinks phones are a good investment and buy a cheap kyocera i had for 10 years not days. complete fail samsung youve cost me more then this phone was worth or atleast what stupid consumers agree to pay. junk...pound salt samsung as for all you fools run far away from this overrated turd of a phone."
"Amazon" "Worker with Verizon  only 12mp camera should have more"
"Amazon" "After years on iPhone, my wife finally got on board an Android phone and she's enjoying every minute of it!"
"Amazon" "Overall OK, but after several techs could not get it to send any texts I had to returned it."
"Amazon" "In love."
"Amazon" "If you like putting your super slim technological wonder into some mammoth case then you'll be fine. Otherwise buy insurance or prepare to replace a lot of screens."
"Amazon" "I love it! Thank you."
"Amazon" "great deal"
"Amazon" "Can't remember the last great phone I've had. The S8 is a fantastic phone."
"Amazon" "The phone we received was a counterfeit. If you have doubts if it is a fake, do some research. When I researched, I found things to try and confirm if it is a true Samsung phone or a knockoff. I did some things like, tap on the back a see if it is plastic or glass and look at the size of the bevel of the phone. Buyer beware!"
"Amazon" "It's all I expected and more. Excellent buy!"
"Amazon" "Beautiful phone"
"Amazon" "Love the phone!"
"Amazon" "Bought this from Samsung unlocked... Nice phone... BUT! THE NEXT BIG THING IS CLEARLY NOT THIS PHONE."
"Amazon" "Great product. Bought it used was scared at first that it won't look satisfying but when it arrived I was amazed that there wasent a scratch on this thing. Thank you so much"
"Amazon" "This phone is ok. The infinity display is ridiculous.  No case will protect it from drops. Had and S5 for years until it was stolen. No problems with mild drops.  Put an Otter box on this S8 plus and have had it for a month, broken screen. Extremely short drop and if the retarded screen wasn't sticking out, nothing would be broke. Brilliant idea Samsung.  What is the point of this? Anyone know? Maybe to sell more screens?"
"Amazon" "I never had this phone but my dad has on it when he told me about this phone and when I see that was extraordinary phone also this phone comes by different ways."
"Amazon" "OhYeah."
"Amazon" "Works with Verizon and AT&T.. Tried both sim cards. No issues. More than likely will work with international sim cards. Upgraded from pixel XL plus."
"Amazon" "Shipping on time was horrible. Other than that phone is really good."
"Amazon" "It's pretty much iphone x but came out super early."
"Amazon" "Awesome phone but if it gets dropped in just the wrong spot, part of the screen will crack."
"Amazon" "Do not purchase this phone. This phone calls people in my contact list all day. This phone opens applications all day. Can't  turn off Bixby which is calling and opening apps indiscriminately and Samsung says that there is no way to disable or turn off the very sensitive Bixby button.  There is no Bixby application button  to open  Bixby if you could turn off very sensitive Bixby button.  Butt dialing or pocket dialing is the issue, sensitive home button that opens the phone when it's locked, sensitive Bixby button that opens the phone when locked, camera on the lock screen opens the camera and starts taking pictures. When holding the phone applications near the edge of the screen and your hand open."
"Amazon" "Everything was fine. I have been using last 4 months. But I did not used the head phone yet. Today when I opened it, it was defected as the picture."
"Amazon" "Upgraded phones with a new phone plan, and got a galaxy s8+.  Regretted it immediately.  First issue - the curved screen means that holding the phone by one hand and typing is difficult as your hand keeps touching the edge of the screen and screwing up typing.  Logged into Google, and begin porting over my contacts.Next problem - contacts show as synced, but several are missing.  As a test, I added a contact via google contact web interface (remember, the phone said it was already synced), and then kicked of another sync.  Again, contact no-show.  Mysteriously 2 hours later, contact showed up.Final problem (and when I returned it and bought an iPhone) - Voice mail never worked.  I didn't bother trying to figure out why, I just returned the phone and upgraded to an iPhone."
"Amazon" "works great..great product love it."
"Amazon" "Not as expected.Very fragile.Low battery life.Screen is a joke, Easily scratches/cracks.Software issues."
"Amazon" "i bought 2 at once. one came with the upper corner not displaying anything. the other is laggyon the upper half of the screen."
"Amazon" "Good as new"
"Amazon" "Simply amazing.. in love with the product and the customer service !!!"
"Amazon" "Absolutely in LOVE with this phone!"
"Amazon" "Sold me a black listed phone and did nothing to try and help out with the problem"
"Amazon" "It arrived before the intended date. I love my new cell phone."
"Amazon" "good!!!!"
"Amazon" "Fast shipping, and it is as described."
"Amazon" "The best phone I owned so far. Absolutely love it!!"
"Amazon" "Poor buying experience. Phone has been shut off"
"Amazon" "just as expected, fast shipping too."
"Amazon" "Great phone!"
"Amazon" "Was wrapped excellently and everything same so neat"
"Amazon" "Phone keeps losing internet connection requiring me to go to T-Mobile to reset it"
"Amazon" "I have the 8+ and sence last update the wifi well not stay connectes ... this th worst  phone i have  ownd.. i miss my moto.."
"Amazon" "Much better than my refurbished Note 4."
"Amazon" "Delivered on time this phone is amazing"
"Amazon" "Device arrived in great condition and all was set up perfectly."
"Amazon" "D phone is excellent"
"Amazon" "Hi my name is Jazzy Le I am a youtuber with 87k subscribers. I want to review your product because I reviewed a iPhone 7 plus which I have but I honestly don't like it and neither do my subscribers. I was wondering If I can do a comparison video. Go check my channel Jazzy Le if you want to. Please get back to me as fast as you can"
"Amazon" "Very good. Still checking out"
"Amazon" "Feature plagued as usual.No home button, but you will summon Bixby which you cannot disable.I dont like paying 750 for an advertising robot."
"Amazon" "Amazing phone I love it"
"Amazon" "Perfect phone"
"Amazon" "Perfect"
"Amazon" "Garbage"
"Amazon" "Huned👊👊👌🏿👌🏿👌🏿"
"Amazon" "Cracked way to easy"
"Amazon" "Got this phone for free from employer. Samsung Camera stops working. Ruined my vacation. Samsung keyboard stops working. Can't download apps. Phone Screen gets ON unnecessarily. Phone reset is not a solution at all. Samsung should stop making phone OS."
"Amazon" "It's been a month and I already regret the purchase. My screen cracked from a 2 foot fall, and with a protective case on it. I've never seen a phone this fragile."
"Amazon" "on time and as described.  Samsung Galaxy.  Enough said..."
"Amazon" "The phone is as expected, but if you drop it and you are guaranteed to drop it within 2-3 years that you plan to use it it will 100% break because it's fragile."
"Amazon" "Excelent"
"Amazon" "Its ok"
"Amazon" "Good phone, but the difficulty associated with rooting and the issues with the seller force me to give it a three."
"Amazon" "screen scratches so easily its a joke"
"Amazon" "Never again Samsung. If youre like me and read reviews maybe you feel bamboozled. Who puts out a video prooving how shatterproof the screen is but is rated THE POOREST EVER and easiest to break? I am pissed! Even though you may love the phone, you wont love paying 200-500 for multiple screens. I may ship back to samsung and tell them to..."
"Amazon" "K"
"Amazon" "Very disappointing battery life just like my old Galaxy S5. Why can't Samsung make the charger port micro usb like everyone else on the planet (except Crapple, of course)? At least they do provide an adapter with the phone which is easily lost. Sin cards are not backwards compatible with old Galaxy S models which cost me an extra $25 for a new sim card to make this phone operational."
"Amazon" "Fingerprint reader is not that Big of an issue people, its an amazing phone stop reading useless reviews and get it."
"Amazon" "No issues so far"
"Amazon" "bixiby button it is a pain, got watch out how grab your  phone  from anywere that button will initiate bixby."
"Amazon" "Product was a lemon, within a week out of the box developed touchscreen problems. Contacted samsung technical support and was told the only recourse I had was to ship the device out to some nebulous repair facility for approximately 1 month. Was acknowledged as a defect yet would still not exchange device for a functional unit without a 1 month turnaround.I have used galaxy devices from S3-S6 and after this will never purchase another samsung electronic of any variety."
"Amazon" "Amazing phone but I order the cricket sim card kit with it and didn't receive it. I only got the phone"
"Amazon" "This phone is an abysmal waste of money. It is a budget phone pretending it wants to be a $600 phone.First week of owning it without any drops, a few random columns of the phone turned pink, wont go back.The charging port only works about 60% of the time. The other 40 % of the time will say that it has moisture in the port and will refuse to charge.After the first 3 months the phone becomes extremely sluggish when moving between apps and different home screens, while I am use to this slowdown on mobile devices, this is the only time it started slowing down before I had owned it for a single quarter.This phone will give you about as much functionality as one of those old Nokia phones with how sluggish, inconsistent and poorly constructed it is."
"Amazon" "The worst cellphone never!! The display says that is gorilla glass. It crashes for nothing and strikes with something simple that the earings.Never gonna buy this again!!"
"Amazon" "bricked in a month!!! Need to now ship it to repair center in Texas, minimum of 3 weeks process for repairs :("
"Amazon" "Not headphones arrived, what happen??"
"Amazon" "Nice"
"Amazon" "phone battery is quickly discharged. I am using minimum apps but still discharging faster than I expected when bought this phone"
"Amazon" "Not charging"
"Amazon" "Causing problems with my order"
"Amazon" "Bought for my wife for christmas was delayed for 2 days then when i recieved it i opeened it there was no phone inside only a charger amd owners manual"
"Amazon" "phone is NOT unlocked as in you do NOT have root permission on the phone.this indicates there are applications (bloat ware) still installed and eating up battery, with potential security holes.other than that the phone is very good.absolute must is a big strong case for this phone, it is VErY fragile."
"Amazon" "Very Fast ....but the battery needs to be more ./..."
"Amazon" "I want a sample or trial period for this item"
"Amazon" "Out of this World Excellent"
"Amazon" "I would love a free sample of this product that my friends and others can see."
"Amazon" "Its a little hard to get use to compared to the s5 I had. But otherwise I like it"
"Amazon" "Thank you.  All be ok."
"Amazon" "I was enticed by Samsung's $200 trade in program. Sent them my perfectly working iPhone 5s. But Samsung charged me $175 to my card and mentioned that my phone does not qualify for the $200 rebate program. This is a bait and switch program by samsung. There is no explanation why my good working iphone 5s did not qualify for trade in program.Be aware of this samsung's trade in program! They are fraudulently charging credit cards based on this trade in program."
"Amazon" "My first new smartphone purchase since the S6. and I can't say I'd recommend it. It is *huge* and heavy. My small hands grow sore after only a few minutes of holding it while lying in bed. Its a burden to carry in my handbag and doesn't fit easily in my pants pocket. The most annoying feature is Bixby. The placement of the button wasn't well thought out and there is no way to disable this feature. The straw that broke the camel's back was the constant freezing up of my screen even with light use and minimal downloaded apps. Downgraded to an S7."
"Amazon" "Best cellphone ever"
"Amazon" "Didn't work for me. I took this phone to too different Metro PCS locations and they both said the same thing, no signal and activation won't go through."
"Amazon" "Get Bixby off of the phone"
"Amazon" "Package arrived today with the s8+ BOX and all (charger etc) BUT NO PHONE. I AM SO DISAPPOINTED. Payed this much for just a box! THINK TWICE BEFORE BUYING OR END UP HAVING A BAD TIME. Hoping for a replacement or at least a refund because I purchased a phone NOT JUST A BOX."
"Amazon" "Great phone, screw bixby."
"Amazon" "This phone has been way below expectation.  This my third galaxy and this one already has to be sent back for repair.  I've had it 2 weeks and to send it for repair. Will require almost 2 weeks.I'm a business owner so really????  Perhaps friends are right...should have gone to an I phone 8."
"Amazon" "Cherry"
"Amazon" "It DOPE,IT REALLY DIFFERENT"
"Amazon" "screen protector scratches easily, and the edges do not bend enough for the curved screen."
"Amazon" "Phone not powering. If I could give it a no star I would have..."
"Amazon" "i'd rather have my flip phone"
"Amazon" "Th h"
"Amazon" "Does not work! No caller ID all phone calls show up as unavailable, no voicemail or texting of pictures. Carrier says it is a defective phone and something to do with the way it is unlocked."
"Amazon" "this Samsung terrible sound speaker don't have a good sound, in the max hear distortion, the camera is awfull with low lights or in the night.is a little bit slow considering that have a big processor and enough ram.I try the camera phot and video don't have a good quality.the face recognition don't work with low lights.a big error is putted the volume keys in the left side, is practical in the right side.the battery is low, lost the charge very fast..I did a mistake to buy this expensive cellphone..."
"Amazon" "having trouble when the phone updates other than that the phone is interesting."
"Amazon" "The round aged glass is horrible! It is very nice but a nightmare in trying to keep the glass protected and using a phone case . Because its round age the glass protectors keep popping off. This is a lot to pay for a phone and have a good case to protect it!!"
"Amazon" "BAD PRODUCT NEVER BUY SAMSUNG AGAIN• Only allow me use it 2 days.• No International warrantee so I lost my money• Common problem with this modelOnly works fine 2 days and suddenly white strip appear on right third on entire screen, couple ours after that (following samsung support) made a factory reset and few our after that, screen go black in a middle of a whatsapp message and never turn on again.INTERNATIONAL WARRANTEE INEXISTENT (so international buyers don't even think about buy samsung products like i do)Amazon support was great, but only and exclusively with limitation only for US main territory and if you think pour guy bad luck, don't think that, the problem on this model is high.I share with you this comment like think to make with my more than 15k followers on social networks, I NEVER BUY SAMSUNG PRODUCT AGAIN, my last item was gear 360 and guess what?, no work with Samsung Phone's (only with S6 S7 S8) extensively on other post,I said \"my bad\" to don't be more literate about product, only read about 15 hrs with reviews with another products, and because that and exclusively to use this camera buy a S8,If you have heard about battery explosion on 7 version I'm thinking \"this thing\" was remembered like a S8 minor problem."
"Amazon" "It gets stuck. Have to  force restart frequently."
"Amazon" "Pretty cool"
"Amazon" "Piece of junk!  Have to shut phone off to get notifications.  Not good for my business."
"Amazon" "My boyfriend J, loves his new phone, its a phone he likes he said after using it for some hours."
"Amazon" "I received an empty box .. I demand my money back"
"Amazon" "The phone itself is pretty good and have had the phone about a month ans i was in class and dropped it fell out od my pocket and the screen shattered. I have never had such a cheap screen. They want more than 500 dollars to replace it."
"Amazon" "Thank you"
"Amazon" "I hate Bixby, and so will you. Don't buy this. Buy literally any other phone."
"Amazon" "Curved display was a huge mistake by Samsung."
"Amazon" "I bought one of these and I hated it.  Two days later took it back and got a different brand.  It is great if you are a previous Samsung user."
"Amazon" "I checked online to see if this phone was compatible, verizon website confirmed it was but I needed a new SIM for it as mine was an older model.  When I got there all they would say was that this phone was incompatible with their network and there was nothing I could do.  Ordered the SIM through their website so I'll update if it actually works, but so far it's been a no go for Verizon."
"Amazon" "Great looking phone but not a good daily driver.  Very slippery and edge to edge screen too prone to accident touching.  I keep tapping on the phone icon by accident while holding the phone.  Bezels being too thin here really is problematic.  Apple has much better accident touch detection.A case can help with the issue but can't fix the really weak battery life.  Typical daily use, I am down to 54% by noon time.  Requires charging, luckily there is fast charging.  They should include a bigger battery not smaller.The new touch screen home button is very confusing and awkward to use.  I have used Pixel, Nexus 6P, this new home button mimicks a physical one but performs very slowly in responsiveness.  You really have \"find\" the home button.  It doesn't just press anywhere on the bottom to activate it.The screen also seems to lag behind S7 Edge in responsiveness.This is not a good phone for Pokemon Go at all.  The battery life sucks and the phone isn't much faster than S7 Edge.Plus side camera and screen quality is great but not a huge leap over the S7 Edge."
"Amazon" "A 600 dollar pile of whale terd! Anything is better than this junk."
"Amazon" "Someone hacked into my account and purchased this phone, therefore I don't have a review..."
"Amazon" "Have only had it for 5 days and the screen has scratches all over"
"Amazon" "Samsung devices are terrible and poorly made."
"Amazon" "I don't know this version doesn't support Arabic interface and middle east countries, so bad"
"Amazon" "I have 2 weeks with it and Yesterday fell down and it Is brocken now 🤧😠😹"
"Amazon" "Hasnt infrared portThe screen is too long, but not so height"
"Amazon" "we ordered a Samsung Galaxy S8+, and it was to take it as a gift in Madagascar. The person opened it and realized that its a Samsung S8 and not a + while we paid full price for it."
"Amazon" "VERY DISSAPOINTED THAT THIS PHONE BROKE  INSIDE AND OUT AFTER A VERY MINOR DROP NOT EVEN FIVE DAYS AFTER RECIEVING IT .WILL NO LONGER BUY SAMSUNG PRODUCTS . IT IS VERY FRAGILE TO BE SO EXSPENSIVE WHATS THE POINT OF IT BEING WATERPROOF IF IT SO EASILY BREAKS ON DRY LAND . THATS  ONLY HELP TO A FISH WHICH I AM NOT . WILL BE USING APPLE PRODUCTS FROM NOW ON ."
"Amazon" "This phone sucks"
"Amazon" "It's ok"
"Amazon" "Replica box says s8 but the phone is s5 with sticker saying s5. The phone will not power up, if you put magnet on the screen it sticks, if you put a magnet on real screen it will not stick because it is glass . I paid over $600 for this for a family member visiting from Trinidad and this is what we get.  Amazon is to big with with no quality checks on its vendors. I bet this will not be allowed to be posted but I willl be reaching out to the better business bureau"
"Amazon" "Excellent phone, beautiful aesthetics, and a taste of the future worth paying for: 9/10.TL;DRGorgeous & futuristic phone, industry-leading screen, excellent and reliable (rear AND front) camera, full-day battery, water and dust proof, wireless (fast) charging, and Bluetooth 5.0!  On the downside, it won't receive timely software updates, and fingerprint scanner location is a minor setback.It's hard to choose your next phone because there are so many good options today, and potentially good phones coming later this year (2017). By now you've probably seen a million reviews on the S8, but it doesn't make the decision easier. Here's my suggestion, in two quick steps. Make sure none of the cons below are deal-breakers for you. Then, look over the list of unique advantages, and see if they get you excited enough to pay the hefty $750. If you're still here after that, then welcome to the club! Be sure to check out my final tips for maximizing your S8 experience.CONS:1. Edge screen is beautiful, but annoying in two situations.  It creates visual distortions a little (less than S7 Edge though).  It is also difficult to hold the phone up in the air, face down (e.g. before sleep), as the phone is prone to accidentally registering side touches.  A case remedies the latter problem, but I dislike putting a case on such a beautiful phone (see pro tip #1).2. Samsung is not very good with software updates.  If you take great pleasure from trying new Android in a timely manner, this isn't for you -- the only two options are iPhones and Pixels.  That said, keep in mind that new software updates typically slow down the phone.3. Fingerprint scanner location has been mentioned a gazillion times.  Yes, I wish it was on the front.  No, it really isn't that bad on an S8 (S8+ is a different story).  You know, we have this thing called \"muscle memory\"..  It took me two days to adjust to the new location, and now I have no problems.  If you really hate it, try facial recognition or iris scanner, they're very good (see pro tip #8)4. The phone has glass back that’s prone to cracking, so watch out if you’re clumsy.  But see pro tip #15. S8 doesn’t have monster battery life, and it needs to be charged once a day.  If you need to go past a day, look elsewhere.6. Some are disappointed about a lack of dual-camera.  Personally, the rear camera is wide enough that I am rarely in a situation where I feel the need for a wide-angle lens (like in LG).  An optical zoom would have been nice (like in Iphone 7+), but not really an issue for me (see pro tip #6)UNIQUE ADVANTAGES1. Futuristic aesthetics of a bezelless all-screen phone.  This doesn’t really improve the functionality of the phone, but there’s just something satisfying about this futuristic experience.2. The screen is just so damn beautiful, no contest here.  Always-on display is useful.3. As of today, it’s the only phone that checks ALL of my needs: Excellent rear camera, excellent front camera (reviewers too often ignore this), water proof, dust proof, wireless (fast) charging, full-day battery life, a headphone jack, a micro SD card slot, fingerprint scanner, and after using the S8, Bluetooth 5.0!4. Bluetooth 5.0 is amazing.  S8 is a first phone to come with this, and it’s awesome.  I frequently use the ability to connect to two different speakers at once, for a surround-sound like experience in my room.  You can also listen to the same music with your friend in a library, by connecting to two different headphones.5. S8 is also the first phone to come with Gigabit LTE, which is nice for future-proofing the phone, but it doesn't quite help us yet.PRO TIPS1. Consider getting a tempered-glass screen protector (they’re better on S8 than on S7 Edge) and a Slickwraps/dbrand skin for the back.  The skins make your phone look unique, improves grip, and it also helps cover up cracks if you’ve dropped your phone.  Slickwraps frequently has discount promotions on their website, so watch out for that.  Don’t use a case, enjoy the beautiful phone!2. Bixby is useless, and if you’re like me, most “Smart” assistants are still generally not helpful and just raises privacy concerns.  You can remap the Bixby button (as of April 2017): See https://www.xda-developers.com/3-applications-bypass-bixby-restriction/3. General Android tip: Go to Settings, Developer Options, set Window/Transition/Animator animation scales to x0.5 to speed things up (Google this if you don’t know what I mean)4. General AMOLED tip: Take advantage of black wallpapers to save battery life5. Set screen resolution up to QHD.  In my experience it barely affects battery life in everyday use.  Going HD will significantly improve battery life if you are a heavy gamer, or use CPU intensive apps a lot.6. If you really miss dual-camera set-ups in other phones, consider getting a separate smartphone camera lens kit that sells for ~$20.  They’re less convenient than a built-in dual lens, but on the upside they’re much more versatile and fun.7. If you are still not convinced whether to buy S8, then wait.  Most phones (except iPhones and Pixels) drop prices relatively quickly, and you may be able to snatch one up cheap refurbished in auction sites.8. Contrary to some reviews, the facial recognition and the iris scanner are reliable and fast.  In my experience, how you register your face/iris determines how effective it will be.  If you wear glasses, register with glasses on.  Also, register under medium lighting conditions and not in extreme conditions.  You want the phone to be able to recognize you under different environments.It's a really nice phone, highly recommended."
"Amazon" "I bought a real cell phone for more than 600 dollars, not in the most expensive piece of plastic in history. They sent me a toy used in stores to avoid theft, with no commercial value. The screen image is printed, there is no battery. I have been cheated. They did not bother sending a dummy for a Galaxy S8, it looks like an S6"
"Amazon" "Warning to everyone buying this phone: these phones are fake, mine wasn't sending or receiving pictures. Went to my mobile provider and they informed me that the phone was a fake. Back should be made out of glass, these are made with plastic. Also the bottom of the phone should say galaxy s8 and not have these little pictures ."
"Amazon" "I received a piece of steel . Im sending it back"
"Amazon" "Beware this could be a model that has the wrong firmware on it. It may not be possible to swap the firmware. It'll have the languages on it, etc. such that it is usable however, there could be things on your calendar that can NOT be removed, other aspects of the phone could change depending on the firmware installed. The alerts(test, amber, etc.) cannot be turned off with this foreign firmware. Even if they say they're turned off, they will come through whenever they're sent, think about it.This is my issue with the phone for the software, I come from having a note 3 and a note 5, I am basically spoiled by the notes, the screen is better in that I don't have to worry about a beveled screen. That aspect of the screen DOES alter how what you're looking at appears there. I do a lot of reading, its annoying to have the screen like that."

"Amazon" "Any one want to buy Samsung S8 or S8 plus should wait for the U.S. version with Qualcomm 835 release which is May 31.Qualcomm 835&Adreno 540 are much better than Exynos 8890/8895&Mali-71. Especially when you use cellphone to play 3D games. Many games do not support Mail GPU, Like you use AMD graphics to play large 3D games it will has a lot of problems such as reboot, not support Anti-aliasing, Cannot open in-game special effect.Exynos is 14nm=8890, 10nm=8895 & 2.3+1.7GHz But Qualcomm is 10nm & 2.35+1.9GHz, Able to run at a higher frequency for more stable time.And the most important thing, The International version Exynos 8890 or 8895 Only support GSM unlock, But US version Qualcomm 835 Unlock the entire network CDMA and GSM, Meaning that you can use this phone at any network company in the world."
"Amazon" "very  nice amazing phone"
"Amazon" "It's been less than a month since I bought my Samsung Galaxy S8. and this Phone is more fragile than Samuel Jackson on the Movie \"Unbreakable\". I committed the biggest mistake of my life when I decided to get rid of my Google Pixel XL phone. It is like ending your relationship with your legitimate girlfriend to date a prostitute. I used to be a big fan of Samsung Galaxy phones. (Bought Google's Galaxy Nexus, Samsung Galaxy S2, Note 3, Note 5) they were strong phones. now that I bought my Galaxy S8 it fell on the SOFT CARPET on the floor and the screen Shattered. now I regret purchasing this phone, but it is good to learn from our mistakes. :D and this is the last Samsung Product I ever purchase on the rest of my life. I will give LG brand products a chance to be part of my life."
"Amazon" "Probably the most feature packed phone out right now. Looks stunning, performs great, amazing camera, best screen on a smartphone hands down. I love the iris scanner which works flawlessly even in a fully dark room which amazes me. Battery life has been great so far lasting me through a full day easily but I do have to charge it every night. Charging this phone is not as fast as some other phones like oneplus 3, honor 8 or the axon 7. but you have wireless charging which makes up for it. The headphones included in the box are great as well. The fingerprint scanner location is not an issue for me, I have a case on and it's not difficult to reach but it does take some getting used to. The camera is also one of the best right up there with the google pixel.The sound is pretty good, not amazing like stereo speaker phones but its loud and clear enough. it's easy to use with one hand even though it has a huge 5.8-inch screen thanks to the new 18.5 by 9 screen aspect ratio and the 84% screen to body ratio."
"Amazon" "its not unlocked :("
"Amazon" "As expected. 100% unlocked. Good presentation."
"Amazon" "Excelent !! Will buy again. Thank you !"
"Amazon" "I was nervous about buying the phone online and if i would receive a take s8. I ordered two, one in gold and one in midnight black. They are both clean and came with the original parts of the s8. I took a chance hoping they would be real after researching fake s8's and about the company I can say they are the real thing."
"Amazon" "****updated on 07/13/2017: I called local repair shop and they wanted to charge me $369 for the new screen. It does not even come with water resistance warranty. Yike!!!! This is not goood :(------------------------------------------I used to be a big fan of Samsung mobile devices. I used to own Galaxy S2, Note 2, Tablet (8 Pro?),... but I switched to be Apple fan after many losing battles against Samsung over their bad batteries and microUSB adapter issues.Recently, after many comparison between Samsung Galaxy S8 vs iphone7, I decided to make a switch back to Galaxy S8 because of its stunning screen display and the water resistance issue. I saw a review somewhere which said the S8 can handle water resistance better than the iphone7.UNFORTUNATELY, the sunning screen display of the Galaxy S8 disappoints me BIG time. It is really beautiful but this screen is very easy to break. I slipped it off my desk from alarm vibration and the screen cracked all over the front glass (the front screen hit the hardwood floor first from the drop). This incident happened to me after my 5 days of ownership with this phone. How disappointed! Unfortunately Samsung does not cover warranty for this type of thing, so please aware of this major issue and make according investment for protection plan.In more detailed feedback, here are 10 features I can say I love about this phone:1. Captured video and images by front and back cameras are all excellent (compared to iphone7). I took it to capture a few action moment at a beep baseball game this past weekend and all pictures and videos look stunning GREAT.2. finger print, iris scan and many smart login features are awesome.3. screen display looks stunning. No doubt here!4. phone size is fittable to hold in one hand5. expandable storage. Kudo to Samsung for starting the phone with 64GB as its based storage.6. great sound for media (Netflix, youtube, HBO and many other streaming services)7. great sound for phone conversation as well. I was driving on highway with my window slightly open (for air ventilation), and I could talk to my mom without and issue. Normally with other phone, she would not hear anything I said because of the hissing noise.8. wireless charging capability9. S8 supports USB-C type for easy insertion and removal of the cable. Samsung also provides an adapter for microUSB. I love this thought a lots when I saw it.10. Edge panel feature is pretty cool for quick app access.and here are features which make me hate this phone:1. The finger print button is on the back of the phone. I have a wallet styled case for the phone and it is not easy to reach the fingerprint button on the back. It would be great if there are both front and back or side buttons for this finger print feature.2.  stunning glass screen is very vulnerable to crack and shatter. The phone's frame does not have protection for the screen when there is a drop impact. Very sad now to see my new phone with damaged screen.3.  the compartment for the sim and microSD is somewhat hard to use. I found it to be challenged to sit both the sim and microSD card for insertion.4. Battery is not that great based on Samsung advertisement. Compared to iphone7, this S8 drains more battery.5. theme support does not have many free items. Most of the cool themes cost to own, so don't bother.6. curved screen sometimes cause issue for text to display and reading at side edgesCool advertised feature about the phone which I haven't gotten a chance to try:1.IP68 rated water resistance is cool but now the screen is cracked, so I haven't gotten a chance to try it. This water resistance feature was the main reason I bought the S8 over the iphone7, but now I cannot even utilize it.My wish: I hope Samsung pays more attention to the screen design and make it more bullet proof with better performance to accidental drop and bump impact. What is the point of having a stunning screen but it is so fragile to break.FINAL THOUGHT: I WOULD GIVE THIS PHONE A 5 STAR IF ITS SCREEN IS NOT FRAGILE. If anyone wants to buy this phone, be prepared to protect your screen. Invest into their Samsung Primary Care protection or buy good screen protector and case. Personally, when new iphone comes out, I might need to switch again as Samsung is once again losing me.Attached are pictures and videos I captured at the beep baseball game"
"Amazon" "As expected. Would by from this seller again."
"Amazon" "Solid performance, beautiful design, the latest processor as of 04/28/2017, Bluetooth 5.0! They fixed the problem that I had with the Galaxy S7 Edge that I often accidently touched the edges of the screen, it doesn't happen with the \"edges\" of this screen anymore. I have a Google Pixel XL and I'm going to switch for the Samsung Galaxy s8, not the S8+, because even with my big hands I have to stretch my hand to be able to reach for the fingerprint sensor of the S8+. The screen of the S8 is even bigger than the Google Pixel XL by 2% already and the total size of the phone is smaller than the Pixel XL.In terms of the software update, it's slower to be released than for the Google Pixel XL, but it's faster than for the carrier phones, like AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, etc.You can't go wrong with this phone, in general terms, comparing all the features, pros and cons, it's the best in the market.Pros:-Design-Wireless Charging-Latest processor-Bluetooth 5.0-Mobile HDR Premium technology-No problems (at least for me) in touching the edges of the screen accidently.-water/dust resistance IP68-Good battery optimization-USB Type-C-headphones 3.5mm input-AKG earbuds included-Great quality camera-Beautiful display (image)-USB Type-C to USB adapter included-USB Type-C to USB adapter included-Pay safely virtually at any store with Samsung Pay (something that Apple Pay and Android Pay can't do)-Comes already with Android 7.0 Nougat-Expandable storage via MicroSD Card.Cons:-Comes with 64GB of internal memory with no other options with more storage other than through the MicroSD card-No unlimited storage on the cloud for pictures and videos (like Google Pixel and Pixel XL)-Fingerprint in one of the worst places possible.-Sound not that great with only one speaker (not stereo)"
"Amazon" "Very nice phone all around.Pros:Great design.Amazing form factor for the size.Pretty fastGreat cameraCons:Tends to lose WiFi connection where my Pixel XL does notSamsung is too pushy with adds from their apps.Forced to have some Samsung apps and even facebook (cannot uninstall)Gets laggy every now and then.Slow android updates."
"Amazon" "The infinity screen (formally edge) hinders so much. Hard too keep your fingers off the scream while holding it and that causes all kinds of issues. Nobody can make a good case for it... too much glass exposed on the edges. Text and images wrap around the edges. And to make matters worse: Bixby!"
"Amazon" "Beautiful phone with great functionalities and it is an incredible advancement from my old Samsung Galaxy Avant which is a great working phone, but it's been getting buggy in the last six months. I got mine through Fed Ex this morning so I will update my post in a few weeks but so far, I could not be happier. I got my phone from a different vendor out of Australia but shipped directly to me from Hong Kong, but I suspect it will be the same phone no matter when you buy it.My service provider is Metro PCS, which I am very happy to find out that I can keep and I took my phone to my local Metro PCS store and they got my phone working in less than 15 minutes. They explained the functions of the SIM slot #1 and #2 and how to insert a micro card. I had Metro add the International Calling plan to my phone for texting and calls from the U.S. I will use the SIM slot #2 for when I travel to France. Having a backup will help out.The style and glass front of the phone is very nice and it does not leave fingerprints. My old phone is the Samsung Galaxy Avant and I find that having my new phone is not difficult to re-learn. Some of the basic functions are the same.After getting home, I entered my passcode for my home wi-fi and the phone took it immediately and updated itself promptly. I also got the bluetooth function connected to my Fiat Sport 500c in less than five minutes. The batter powers up in no time to full and this morning, out of the box, my phone was at about 50% power. It took about 30 minutes to get it to 100%. So far, the battery tends to drain slowly.I read from another post of this phone that it did not have wi-fi. Not sure what happened, but this phone certainly does have it.The cord has a different end that plugs into the phone, so my old USB cords won't work however, the S8 box includes some attachments. One attachment is a small add-on that will fit on the small end of the USB cord so you can keep your old cords. The box also adds a connector so you can transfer files from one phone to another, or a computer to your phone and finally a 100-240 charging plug is included in the box, but it is not for European sockets nor American sockets. The two male connectors are slightly slanted so I suspect this is for Asia.I am not going to clone my Galaxy Avant software to my new phone because I want to begin fresh again. I will pick and choose each app but my Avant still works at home with my wi-fi and Magic Jack phone.There is only one slight disappointment; I expected the phone to be more of a gold tone color. The back of the phone is not really gold, but a slight gold tone with an odd color that seems to change color depending on the light available. Also, the front glass is gold tone once you pull up the apps, SMS, dialer, etc.I find this phone to be very advanced and a very good buy for the money I paid. It's basically a mini-computer and I use it for everything from driving, texting, phone, pictures, banking, buying, etc.This phone is definitely an incredible upgrade from my Avant and I am very pleased. I will update my post in a few weeks to a month."
"Amazon" "Paying almost 900 dollars for a phone and then some for a case you'd think it wouldn't break. My screen has shattered twice now. I've never broken a phone before in my life. I've never dropped this phone either. One minute it's fine and the next it's shattered. It was in my purse all day next to my cloth wallet. I never set my purse down nor did it get hit/leaned on/thrown/etc.. I pull out the phone and it's shattered. I'm so frustrated and angry that something this expensive would break for no apparent reason. TWICE. If I could give 0 stars, I would. This is absurd. I want my money back."
"Amazon" "epic connectivity.  I am currently writing this review using a Bluetooth keyboard, and old fashioned wired USB mouse (connected with the Samsung includes USBC to USB connector), wired headphones, and smart link connection to a SmartBeam Laser projector.  so basically what I'm saying is that Samsung has achieved the desktop experience through a smartphone.  and all of this was set up in under 5 minutes on a Sunday morning.only criticizm I have, which has frustrated me for years with Samsung, is that the phone form factor is still too big.  yes, I knew this when I ordered it, but there's no other way to get all these features with a smaller screen.  maybe one day Samsung will make an iPhone SE Slayer in the S9 mini?"
"Amazon" "I have progressed from the S6 through the S7 and now to the S8.The S8 is just OK compared to the S7 based on my experience.I REALLY do not like the fact that they took away the Home button.  It is so convenient to use it to activate the screen.  The current design is a kludge.The buttons for volume and for Bixby are almost directly opposite to the power button.  This is the worst design ever.  As a result, trying to turn off the screen is an extreme pain and usually results in a photo of my hand or activating Bixby or changing the volume.  My old iPhone had a good design, with the power button on top.  I'd have moved back to Apple, but can't stand the restrictions, like on managing music.The phone is a bit faster than the S7, but I have trouble with it responding to my touch.  That could be a symptom of the screen protector causing interference though.I am not a fan of the curved edges, preferring the flat screen.The display quality is great.The fingerprint scanner is inconvenient, but I knew that was the case going into this phone."
"Amazon" "Product i received is defective continuously drops signal and is not registering to the network even though it is the international version and i am using in Jamaica, The bluetooth doesn't work either.The item was shipped to the US then brought to Jamaica and now to send back the item i have to stand the charges which is stupid. Reps provide contradicting informationI've always been a strong advocate and prime member for amazon but this experience changed everything."
"Amazon" "The cell phone does not come only the box, it seems strange that I was not sent"
"Amazon" "This is a beautiful phone. I definitely wanted to experience something small but with a larger screen. A lot of people complain about the  location of the fingerprint scanner, which does  take some getting used to. But keep in mind that this is actually a natural position to place the scanner. Hold whatever phone you have in your hand and really think about where you place your fingers and how you are holding your device. See what I mean? I found this new location much more convenient than using the scanner with my thumb on the front of my phone.Unfortunately, there was something I couldn't get past with this particular model. The edges are more pronounced and cause a plastic-y looking glare when in the sunlight. I almost switched back to my iPhone 7 plus, but after using the S8 for a few days, it felt, and looked, old and clunky! If you are used to bigger phones, upgrade to the plus. If you've never had a super large phone, the s8 would be perfect for you!Also, please note that the orchid gray doesn't stand out as much indoors, as it appears much darker. When you're outside, the color stands out a lot more.Update: after spending 3-4 days with the s8 plus, I ended up switching back to the s8. The Verizon reps were super helfpul in assisting me throughout this process!"
"Amazon" "This phone is amazing! 1st of all because it was unlocked and I already have metro PCS. I took it to them and they were easily able to get it set up. One TIP is that this come with a european plug, but all you have to do is go to the website and send an email explaining that you need an american attatchment and they will ship you one for free, I recieved two! This is what I sent them, \"Hello, I recently bought an international version of your unlocked Samsung Galaxy S8. It said to contact you if I was in need of a charger that fits American plugs. How do I go about getting one of these and how much are they from you?\" This is what they replied with, \"we will ship you USA plug for it free of charge.\" All I did was click on seller information and put it in an \"ask a question.\" As for the phone it is very smart and connects well with other devices, such as a smart TV especially a Samsung Smart TV. Bixby is the \"siri\" for this device and works great. It adjusts to your needs and even tells you people who you frequently contact at a certain time. This phone is easily customizable and the more you explore with it the more you will find. Battery life and speed of charging is also phenomenal."
"Amazon" "I had recently paid for the unlocked international version of the Samsung Galaxy S8(SM-G950F), however, upon receipt it was the unlocked US model(SM-G950US1) that was being sold for $100 less. It's use was intended for outside of the US. If I knew, I wouldn't have bothered to purchase this.Very disappointing to me. "
"Amazon" "I preordered this phone, not knowing that it was an edge phone, since previous models of galaxies had the normal phones and edge phones separated. I was disappointed to see it was an edge phone since they're more susceptible to break, but I figured it was fine, and I got a case.One week after my phone arrived, it slipped from my lab, falling two feet to the stone floor, shattering my screen. Never in the past eight years have I ever cracked a screen, and I cracked the s8 within a week.Don't believe me? Look up stress tests for the s8, and you'll see it performs worse compared to previous phones.Pros:1. Nice camera2. Great battery life3. TONS of storage spaceCons:1. Breaks far too easily2. Fingerprint scanner not located in a convenient location, and it usually takes ~10 tries to get the phone to even recognize my fingerprint.3. The virtual home buttons disappear in some apps, making it annoying to try to close the app quickly.4. There is an extra button added to this phone below the volume buttons for something called \"Bixby\" which advertises itself as being some sort of virtual planner, providing the option to do an amazon search for something using image recognition. It's a cool concept, but I'm always pressing the button when I don't want to see it, and the image search feature is just a commercialized use of computer vision."
"Amazon" "Great phone, perhaps smallest overall size on the market for given size of the screen 5.8 inch."
"Amazon" "Don't listen to the other people reviews that say this phone is fake. This phone only works with GSM carriers if you live in the u.s. your GSM carriers would be AT&T and T-Mobile that means this phone will not work with Verizon or Sprint this phone is 100% real. You might have to get a different charging block just contact Samsung."
"Amazon" "They said it was internationally unlocked and it wasn't. I tried it in Jamaica and the phone was locked.Everything else about the phone is great."
"Amazon" "For those of you that are consider buying this phone, let me mention some common variation of this phone:SM-G955F: International version, Samsung Exynos Processor (supposedly use less battery, last longer) , for GSM carriersSM-G955FD: International version, Duel Sim Card, Samsung Exynos Processor (supposedly use less battery, last longer) , for GSM carriersSM-G955U: US version, Snap Dragon Processor (supposedly better graphic support for gaming), I see people said the unlocked version support both GSM and CDMA carriers, but I do not have this version and have not verify this myself.Above are for S8+, S* is similar, part number replaced 955 with 950, with smaller screen and battery power.I used SM-G955FD:for about a month now, this is the most expensive phone I purchased.  Below is my list of pro and con.Pro:Decent Camera, good with low light environment.Great Battery life, 3500 amh, last longer then any other phone I had in the past.Support wireless charging, water-proof.Less overheating.  It gets warm when playing games while charging but never gets to point where it is too hot to hold.Con:Unusual Screen ratio.  Most game app do 16:9 screen ratio, this phone is thinner so when playing games, there are black boarder on both side and make it look smaller compare to other phone with same screen size in the market.  This also make it more difficult to type, I often press wrong key by accident due to spacing.Overall, I think this is a good phone.  Best Buy is offering a lot of promotion on this phone right now so you might wish to shop around before choosing where to buy it."
"Amazon" "I recently purchased this device not from amazon but from my local Verizon store (I am here to review the device not the seller) , replacing my old galaxy S6 edge. In the past week or so I have fallen in love with this phone the extra little features are awesome. the finger print scanner on the back of the phone was a bit weird to me at first but now that i have gotten a bit more used to it I think it is a nice change. making it easier to unlock your phone as you take it out of your pocket. all in all the device deserves a 4/5. i will explain the reason i think it should get a 4/5 and there is only one issue. If i could give the the device a 4.5 I would but that is not how amazon works.I have one single complaint. the dedicated Bixby button is probably the most annoying thing I have ever used. at first you could remap the button (i changed mine to the home key) but that change would be reverted within a day and you would then have to go remap the key again. just recently Samsung REMOVED the ability to do that because people were using google assistant instead of their own assistant Bixby. since the ability has been removed i ended up having to find an app that made it so i could disable all of the 6 packages that is Bixby. doing this removed all functionality of the dedicated button on the side of the device. It is really stupid to have a pointless button on the side of my phone, but at least i don't have to worry about accidentally pushing it and having an application that i do not want/ use show up on my screen."
"Amazon" "I tried so many \"flagship\"phones that past year trying to replace my S6 edge! From Sony Xperia XZ to htc 10, until I found the Note 7, too bad it was recalled, went on the hunt again, or was it then that I got the XZ?, anyway ended up with the Google Pixel, which though very good, still felt like an unfinished product compared to the Note.Back to this S8 here. I'm gonna just mention the basics, coz I see so many in depth reviews here, so if ur confused about any phone compared to this one, feel free to comment on my review, I'll try to answer from experience!- The edge to edge screen is amazing, put it next to any phone out there and it stands out. I really can't stop looking at it because it's so sharp! Any picture, movie, YouTube video looks just better on this screen.- The camera is just great! While the pixel was advertised as the best camera on a phone, I still think this S8 is a little better.- Games and apps run fluently on this phone, no lags whatsoever, this phone will run anything u throw at, no sweat.- The size is just perfect, and the weight too!  It feels as big as my Google pixel but with twice the screen size (not exact measures if ur one of those! ) iWas gonna get the S8 plus, but felt it was oddly too tall and the width wasn't just adequate to the length, but the S8 is just the perfect size, easier with one hand too.-The battery is nothing special, I can say I'm an above average user and it lasts almost all day. Obviously when u play more or watch more Netflix, on that gorgeous screen, u'll need to charge it twice, but on most days I didn't need to.You'll not regret getting that phone, definitely the best on the market right now. I absolutely it love it and I think you will too!"
"Amazon" "Phone has terrible reception, and this recurring problem with calls where I can hear them but they can't hear me.  Samsung phones have been slipping ever since the S3, which was the last Samsung product I enjoyed.  I'm trying really hard not to get sucked into Apple world, so I sent this back and now have an HTC phone.  Call quality and reception are a ton better on the same carrier, so it wasn't the carrier's fault (as Samsung tried to tell me in several calls to their useless customer no-service in India).  I'd recommend looking elsewhere."
"Amazon" "I won't talk about the phone because we all know its amazing. im going to talk about if it really works internationally and if this is a s8 in perfect conditions. before purchase I was scared the phone wouldn't work in my country do to the lack of reviews and well highly rated reviews. thats why im doing this review this phone came in perfectly."
"Amazon" "I have the phone for more than a month now, it's a beautiful phone, the display looks great, I can copy my photos and music and whatever I want freely to the computer and back unlike on an iPhone. The fingerprint sensor is on the back - not as comfy as the front facing old iPhone sensor but it's usable. it's not a one-hand phone it's a bit bigger than that and I have big hands. I love the pairing with the S3 Gear and the Samsung Health App. It has face unlock and fingerprint reader and passcode. I miss the dedicated silent button from the iPhone this needs to be UNLOCKED before I can silence it but there is a completely unnecessary Bixby button. There should be a silence button instead of that. The camera the iPhone camera is markedly better I'm sorry to say that but looking at the photos I took and I take now I can see it. Overall I think this is the best Android phone you can get I might also get an iPhone but not the X that is hideous with the notch the protruding camera and the glass back - maybe a 7 or 8. Hope they'll come out with something better and I also hope Samsung LISTENS to users. We don't want the Bixby. We want to be able to remap and reconfigure anything this coudl be your true ace vs iPhone that will never allow it."
"Amazon" "Just wanted to write this for those that want to use Samsung Pay but found out they have a Panama phone.With Samsung phones, the country is locked by its CSC number. You can change this by flashing a different country's firmware to the phone. For my phone, I used the Australian firmware with XSA.You can download the FW and find a guide for flashing Samsung firmware (Odin) on Sammobile."
"Amazon" "My first Android was a OnePlus One. Then, a One Plus Two. I have zero complaints about these two phones.The screen on my OP2 cracked, so I decided to splurge and got myself this beauty. In retrospect, I should have just repaired my OP2's screen. The S8 was an absolute (and expensive) disappointment.It gives you gimmicky features such as the iris-scan, the heart-rate monitor, edge-lighting, which are honestly a bit useless, in my opinion. The curved screen, while a novelty, is incredibly pointless, and in fact creates glare at the edges which makes it very hard to see notifications when the phone is mounted in your car.A lot of people are annoyed about the finger-print scanner's location. It's not ideal, but I've tolerated it and it seems to work okay for me.Android purists will not be happy with the fact that Samsung tries to force their \"Google Now\" clone called \"Bixby\" onto the user. It is a complete reinvention of the wheel and does not work nearly as well as \"Google Now\" does. They have even dedicated a button to this abomination and have made sure that it cannot be re-mapped to do anything else. a truly annoying restriction on the user who paid a lot of money to have a customizable phone - Otherwise, I would have gotten an Iphone, had I wanted to be locked into a certain way of doing things.Some very common widgets (Such as Google Keep) simply don't display correctly on this phone. They display perfectly fine on other Android phones, but not on this, possibly due to the aspect ratio.The all-white theme that is forced upon the user is not only an eye-sore, it makes notifications indistinguishable from one another.Ultimately, the phone is nothing more than a status symbol and yes, it's pretty. The display and camera are nice, but that's not something lacking in most modern phones. Please save your money and get something else."
"Amazon" "Beautiful screen, I bought this phone to use in Ecuador and it works."
"Amazon" "I had this phone for less than a week before it started bugging and failing. DO NOT buy the phone from this place, you only have 15 days warranty so if your phone fails after that you are screwed. I was lucky that mine died within a week. I repeat, DO NOT buy a phone from this place. I decided to give them another opportunity buying the Gear S3 which had a defective charger. If you care about your money DO NOT but anything from this place."
"Amazon" "So far everything is good and the phone is working perfectly"
"Amazon" "I've had just about every Samsung Galaxy phone since S2. Loved it. Always a step ahead of Apple and I liked the flexibility of Android. Bought S8 and I had to say it is the worst Galaxy I've owned.The main issue is screen that cracks SO easily. I didn't even drop the phone, I sat down and it was in my pocket, and the little bump of the phone caused the screen to crack. In a few more days I got a few more cracks. There is absolutely no value in the \"infinity\" screen, it's beautiful but worthless. In my 8 years of owning multiple Galaxies I only cracked the screen once, and I dropped it many times. S8 has a design flaw.Then there's Samsung bloatware that annoys the hell out of you. Bixby is useless but you can't disable it. It wakes up when a button is pressed accidentally in your pocket and it starts making noises, sometimes launching apps... What a piece of garbage!Samsung keyboard and speech recognition is much worse than Google's but they enable it by default.At least Samsung has accepted my return and out of loyalty I bought S7 which I am much happier with."
"Amazon" "Love it! I have had all the Samsung phones, with the exception of the Note 7 (we all know why haha), and this one is my favorite so far. Looking fowards to see what they bring to the table with the S9. I bought mine while being stationed in Italy and having the international version makes things sooo much easier when traveling for work and needing different SIM cards while in other countries. After about a month of use, I bought a docking fast charger also to make my life a little easier, since I kept pulling messing up my charging cables. Here is the link for the fast charger, if anyone was curious, along with a case that fits extremely well.Fast Dock Charger:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06ZYLQ2TP?ie=UTF8&tag=cbpreferredbu-20&camp=1789&linkCode=xm2&creativeASIN=B06ZYLQ2TPCase:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XP87DGC?ie=UTF8&tag=cbpreferredbu-20&camp=1789&linkCode=xm2&creativeASIN=B06XP87DGC"
"Amazon" "I order Galaxy S8 , But inseide included in S5 that isChinese producted"
"Amazon" "Nice Samsung!The Galaxy S8 is fast and easy to handle. Its battery lasts twice the time of my old S6.The screen is fantastic: great resolution and brightness.It has great features and to me it represents a great gain compared to the S6.I will look forward the S10."
"Amazon" "Phone looks awesome but was not compatible with Sprint carrier."
"Amazon" "The phone restart alone 2 to 3 times in the day...I will try and format it with new OS...uppdate 30/11/17, now that I want to install new firmware for the signal problem I find out that I received a G950U1, and not the G950F that I ordered"
"Amazon" "SM950F Upgrading from an S5 using straight talk bring your own phone. I did have to get the $59 pack from walmart but only used the nano sim to replace the existing sim that was too large, so I still have the service plan for next month. Switching from one phone to another was a breeze using supplied cables and adapters. Although it did transfer apps but not passwords, for example my wink hub app went over keeping all switches and routines but I had no clue what many of the passwords were. As I was dealing with a dead old phone i could just reset them via that before wiping it. The mains charger has European prongs but I have many USB wall chargers so no big deal. The factory headphones are worse than my $30 ones. But the phone itself is a dream compared to an S5. So much quicker and no lags"
"Amazon" "Item was not sealed properly in box, arrived within the set time however there a 2 minor nicks scratches on the back of the unit, sure not entirely new unit or failed quality control hence price. Phone checks out on IEMI.info though so genuine product."
"Amazon" "Unfortunately , i have to return the product. But i would recommend BDSJ  as they are very prompt and easy to deal with on any issues. 5 stars to their loyalty towards customer service."
"Amazon" "Don't need me to tell you this thing is amazing. Fully waterproof, military grade iris and fingerprint scan, high res, camera stabilizer, wireless charge, ect. On that point though, drop the funds on the wireless charger with a fan... problem is overheating and only charging 10-15%. Turned off fast charge which fixed it. (settings-device maintenance-battery-advanced settings to change fast charge)"
"Amazon" "Damn good phone. Blazing fast. Almost no loading time. This is the perfect android phone ever made.Works with ATT. Make sure you turn off that edge lighting and always on screen to extend your battery life."
"Amazon" "The S8 is a super phone! but like all things in life, it isn't perfect. it is fragile and a finger print magnet... but if you have been using other Galaxy phones then this is no surprise to you. My Biggest beef is with BIXBY!, I'm very disappointed that Bixby is only half baked. Shame on Samsung for not having it ready by release and also for not letting you re-map the Bixby button to something else.. The Battery is O.K. but not great and for the money  I think the phone should have 6Gs of RAM. Screen resolution automatically being set to the lower resolution tells me that Samsung might still be a little gun shy because of what happened to the Note 7.All in all I really like this phone but if you haven't got it yet you might want to wait to see what Bixby is really like, that is if that sort of thing is important to you.**6/2/17 **I had to come back to this and drop a star fro this review because as of today Samsung still is not able to get Bixby up and running in the U.S. I mean what good is a voice assistant device with no voice!!! They originally said it would be up and working in the spring and now they are delaying it again.This makes this phone a great BETA device but definitely not ready for Prime time!! It's like a great looking sports car that can t go past 70 miles per hour!! really!!!  and they dedicated a button to something that they can't get to work!! I' starting to regret that I purchased this thing."
"Amazon" "Great phone!. Excellent puctures! Be aware that this is the G-950U1 unlocked version rather than G-950F that some carriers are offering in LA. I checked frequency bands and It is compatible with frequencies used in Peru"
"Amazon" "Great phone except one star shy of five because of the fingerprint reader only in the rear.  As like many people, I am often unlocking the phone on a table surface.  I don't hold it in my hand much of the time except when walking or making phone calls when moving around.  I don't hold it often such as when sitting at a desk or dinner table.  I have to pick it up and re-hold it a specific way to unlock it using fingerprint identification.  Not a feasible design.  Iris and face recognition are unreliable as a technology with different environments and lighting.  I have to go back to the old fashion pin or easy-to-hack swipe to use the security on it.  Also should mention that the camera lens gets smeared up easily by having the fingerprint reader right next to it."
"Amazon" "I hate Bixby. Samsung please disable Bixby. The phone is a piece of glass. Buy the case before you buy the phone. Otherwise it's a great phone."
"Amazon" "so far so good, I have always been a dedicated samsung galaxy user for years, and I was afraid the invisible menu buttons would give me a hard time to adapt. but after trying it I find it extremely easy to use and I absolutely in love with Bixby"
"Amazon" "Be aware, the phone's screen will crack on the first drop, even if you use a case and screen protector. Unfortunately it happened to me just as it apparently has happened to many other users (if you google galaxy s8 cracked screen, you will find many results)So even though all the rest of the phone is outstanding, I would never ever buy it again as it will not even last even a month. My biggest concern is that repairing a cracked screen costs 200-300 USD and that I know I would have to repair it again just a few weeks later.Of course, I have tried to be very careful, but due to the full glass body of the phone, it is extremely slippery and will slip out your pocket and fall of any surface very quickly and easily.I have been a faithful Samsung customer for many years, but unfortunately I will probably not have a choice but need to look for a high end smartphone of LG, Sony or HTC now.PS: The stunning Edge-Glass-Infinity-Screen design is the cause of this deal braking problem. I guess one has to decide between the most beautiful and most breakable phone, or an a little bit less beautiful but more robust phone."
"Amazon" "The phone is GREAT other than the screen, that will break in a two foot fall, and cost you over $300 unless you have insurance.The most breakable glass on any phone!"
"Amazon" "Phone arrived boxed neatly, works well on the FLOW HSPA+ & GSM networks, however does not work on FLOW's LTE band 13 network in the Caribbean. Appears that some variants of the SM-G950F are compatible with LTE band 13, this one however, does not."
"Amazon" "The screen is really vulnerable so you really need to invest on good screen protector and case. Overall it's the best phone out there right now. Here's a sample shot from it's camera."
"Amazon" "It's good but not quite localized (minus 1 star). Samsung Pay application is in Chinese."
"Amazon" "The Samsung Galaxy S8 is the simply the best phone you can buy in 2017.I have long been an apple fan but when Galaxy S8 was released, that quickly changed.Now I have my hands on, I can simply say this is almost perfect. Why did I say almost? that is because while this design is the future, this phone has it's flaws widely mentioned in many review videos. The biggest being the fingerprint scanner location but that can be neglected as time passes and you get used with the phone."
"Amazon" "It came with double sim tray, a very good plus, I bought it for the color and it was a good thing it had 2 sims. other than that the phone is.... a S8. you know where your $650 USD are."
"Amazon" "This is a fake phone. I got a replica phone. Now I have to return it"
"Amazon" "DONT BUY THIS! THIS IS FAKE / MALFUNCTION ! I received a dummy phone and chargers!"
"Amazon" "My favorite phone EVER. I got the Straight talk version cause I don't like contracts but it's fantastic. This is the best Galaxy phone ever. Last one I had was a Galaxy S5 but the S8 makes the S5 poor in comparison. I didn't know a phone could have such beautiful sound and graphics and great quality. I have wanted the S8 for a long time and just recently bought one, 3 days ago in fact and I absolutely love it. I ordered a clear case just cause I don't want to cover up the beauty of this phone."
"Amazon" "I didn't buy from Amazon but I did get one from Metro-PCS. I'm blown away by this phone and I've only had it about 2 days. First off let me say how great the battery life is. I'll provide a real life example of use. I took it off the charger at about 3pm on 4/27/17. I texted, watched videos, surfed the web for a few hours, played a high graphics game & live streamed on youtube for an hour and the phone is only at 50%. Thats a lot of use for about 12 hours. I loved the S7 edge and this is everything and extra. The screen is outstanding and cant say enough good things about this phone. Its exactly what you want out of a phone plus more. Sure its a lot of money, but you're paying a good price for something simply amazing. If you have the cash, just buy it. It's well worth it."
"Amazon" "Hello, I am drey and was wondering about getting a sample to sponsor this Samsung Galaxy  S8 in comparison to the IPhone (which I have just done) and my Samsung Galaxy s7 in comparison. As far as my research and experience  goes this it the top notch phone and I plan to explain how to my many viewers to transfer them to the #AndroidArmy"
"Amazon" "he “samsung galaxy s8” is one of the best phones I've ever had I can do so much more with it than with other phones. I like it because the battery last me all day when I use it normally. i have more storage the graphics are better I love the quality of this phone. the best part about it is that it's water resistant which means I can drop it in water without worrying but thing is I can't leave it in too long cuz other wise water will get in it. As I said tho it's a great phone in my opinion"
"Amazon" "Gifted to my sister who needed an update from the samsung s4. Yep we both love it. Camera quality is phenomenal."
"Amazon" "Amazon sells these phones without a US recognized IMEI identification number.The phone won't work."
"Amazon" "The phone is valid only in europe. I need a code to unlock The phone"
"Amazon" "Amazon sells these phones without a US recognized IMEI identification number."
"Amazon" "fast. stable.  Recommended by Microsoft.  I am unable to disable Bixby, I do not like bixby.  I will give apple another chance after this one."
"Amazon" "It took awhile to get the phone set up for English. Mine came as a German model. Since I've resolved that issue the phone has performed flawlessly.Takes fabulous pictures and is very fast. Holds a charge for a long time and charges quickly.Bixby is useless to me."
"Amazon" "This is a fake phone. I bought this phone unlock spend 600 plus dollars. In the box fake phone dummy phone and no charger no headphone.Nothing at all in the box."
"Amazon" "Received a plastic model phone with second hand cords that were not official samsung."
"Amazon" "I am so happy with this phone. I am happy to be back with Android after going iPhone for a year. This phone is beautiful. I love the face it has no button on the front. I really enjoy the Samsung fitness features like step tracking and heartbeat checking. It inspired me to get more in-depth with health tracking! The placement of the finger scanner is awkward, but I can live with it."
"Amazon" "i purchased this phone on samsung.com on a discount. If you plan on having a screen protector then dont get this phone. Due to the edges companies have a hard time making good screen protectors. the glass ones pop out or slide and move on the phone screen. the othere non glass ones have bubbles constanly have bubbles on it. if you want a good hardware waterproof, dust proof android phone then you are better off getting last years galaxy s7 of waiting until october for the google pixel 2, etc"
"Amazon" "Props to Samsung on lowering the price and screwing those who purchased the phone on release. Either way it's a great phone especially if you can get it at a low price. -1 Star because there are quite a bit of bugs and bixby voice is still not out...."
"Amazon" "Funciona en Chile"
"Amazon" "Great phone with great sound and picture quality. Still learning all the features. Videos available for tutorial assistance. Great price reduction from a few months back. Get a protective case!"
"Amazon" "Good phone, but a surprize custom fee never mentionned to get it in Canada... added 200$ to the price..."
"Amazon" "Great phone, beautiful design and superb camera. The problem is the version I bought. This \"international version\" that I bought is actually for the United Arab Emirates. It comes with weird preinstalled soft for the contry and a huge and uncomfortable charger with legs incompatible with most of the planet. That's the reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5."
"Amazon" "Before you buy this phone, read reviews on the durability of the screen. There is no question whether or not you will break your screen. It WILL break. My screen broke after 2 weeks with both a screen protector and case on the phone. The S8 has the most fragile screen of any smartphone EVER. Don't believe me? Google it. Do not purchase this phone. Samsung tried to make up for their last failure and just made something equally terrible. There is no way that this screen is made of Gorilla Glass. My LG screen never broke, and I dropped it off of a 10 foot ladder onto concrete. Samsung is a joke. Stay away."
"Amazon" "Excellent! except the color, the orchid gray looks grayer than orchid"
"Amazon" "A huge disappointment, it feels like several steps back from the S7. The curved screen provides no benefits that I have noticed, in fact it has been a hindrance on numerous occasions. The cuvre prevents you from accessing the time bar on some video player when in full screen, making rewinding or fast forwarding a hassle. The phone also features a useless assistant named bixby with its own dedicated button located directly below the volume controls. This frequently causes bixby to accidently open, closing whatever app you were using, whenever you attempt to adjust the volume. Overall a huge disappointment and an overall frustrating device to use"
"Amazon" "Works great! Haven't encounter any bugs or problems with software. Had mines for almost a month with no hiccup or decrease in performance."
"Amazon" "Nice product. Excellent brand, nice flagship samsung."
"Amazon" "Came fully unlocked. Works in Guyana, South America, all I had to do was put my SIM cards in. Features are great, packaging was very secure."
"Amazon" "I've been an iPhone user for many years and just switched from iPhone 6 to the Galaxy S8 and I love this phone! Definitely more fun than an iPhone and runs smooth and fast. Camera quality is simply AMAZING as well!9.5 out of 10!"
"Amazon" "Finnest phone I've seen. This company may not bring creative out of the box stuff (SJ way), but they put all that exists together in the best possible way,Expect nothing new, but all at best!"
"Amazon" "I have a problem because the screen broke, I whant to know if the warranty cover that, becauseI did not buy  screensaver because the screen was resistant to everything."
"Amazon" "the phone works as expected, but if you drop it which yo are guaranteed to do within 2-3 years that you plan to use it it will 100% break. The plastic is very fragile."
"Amazon" "Imei number is original. Phone received in brand new condition and works internationally."
"Amazon" "Amazing phone compared to iPhone 6"
"Amazon" "samsung software is awful and intrusivebixby sucksfingerprint scanner sucksheadphones sucksave yourself the trouble and get an LG"
"Amazon" "Definitely, the best Samsung phone"
"Amazon" "It is a wonderful phone, the camera is excellent. it is very high definition. It is just a very fragile phone for me. I have little kids that sometimes take my phone, and there is no case with a bumper to protect the edge screen from braking if the prone fells."
"Amazon" "yeah wasn't unlocked? hella nice phone but like buy the real one guys:/ didn't work at verizon we tried new sims and all but this fake sorry"
"Amazon" "I am from Honduras, and my cellphone is working as espected, thanks a lot."
"Amazon" "Phone is cool, all as expected. But they sent me single sim version where i expected dual-sim version. But sorted it out with Amazon support, completely satisfied."
"Amazon" "Wow this is a hideously tiny narrow phone, i like samsung and this phone is so depressing to open im sening right backTERRIBLE TINY wow seriously id think about it evennif it was 200 or less i wouldnt buy it ..I currently have the amazon moto g4 but missed samsung i had very first Galaxy captivate 8 years or so ago then had the 4 and wow the 8 is a huge let down ... SAMSUNG step up or your going to force me to apple products i have always avoided  cant believe how poor of size this phone is sad."
"Amazon" "Device its amazing! Everything is workin properly except I can make work Samsung Pay with it since its an unlocked version, besides that everything its amazing which I'll give it 10."
"Amazon" "Excellent!"
"Amazon" "The USB-C port gets broken, is a very common problem with this model, as is an unlocked phone Samsung doesn't provide warranty for it (this is absurd) and the seller doesn't give any warranty either, so, I was rip off, don't let it happen to you."
"Amazon" "Nice phone but far too fragile. Owned it 3 weeks, screen cracked after setting it down on counter. 250-500 to fix."
"Amazon" "I find it a little harder to get used to but I'm figuring it out, I can't get the infinite screan like they show on tv but what do you do.and it is not letting me add pictures to the contacts like I could with my s5 so I will deal with it, too late to get my money back."
"Amazon" "I recently picked up this phone directly with my phone carrier mainly cause they game me free stuff in a limited offer but none the less it is the same phone from Samsung. So far i am loving this phone and I would recommend this phone to just about anyone. Just know it does have glass on the front and back with an edge design so it is not the most durable but i would still recommend someone getting this phone."
"Amazon" "The S8 version I received had Panama firmware installed, some apps like Samsung Pay will not work until that country supports it, so if SPay is a selling point then don't get the international version, or get an international version with firmware from a country the supports SPay. Other than that, no bloatware from carriers, AT&T sim works fine. Camera and screen is amazing, better battery life then my aging S6. USB type C is nice addition, and I can still get SPay on a Gear 3 smart watch, would be 5 stars if not for the SPay region locks, still a great purchase."
"Amazon" "very nice phone. i had it for two weeks now and works great , i live in Honduras C.A ,super fast , love this color,"
"Amazon" "Over emphasis on the screen @ the expense of the poor placement of the fingerprint sensor does not justify to expense.  Poor customer orientation continues with the inability to re-map Bixby key.  AI is not very useful."
"Amazon" "Love international version. Love this phone.It's like endless possibilities with this one."
"Amazon" "Great case and as its rubber its kind grippy too so easier to hold onto the phone."
"Amazon" "Beware as the screen on the Galaxy S8 is very, very fragile. I had a proper rubber case and a screen protector but the screen cracked completely with a small drop. Figuring out how to get the screen replaced is a challenge, but when I finally got through to the right person it turns out that, as this is an international model, it can only be repaired back in the country of origin... which, even if I was so inclined, is a mystery to me.So, I have a brand new phone with a wrecked screen and no way forward to get it fixed. If I liked the phone more, I might try to jump through additional hoops but it's really not particularly good. Okay, but not great. Be warned, if you buy one also buy the thickest, heftiest possible protective case and hope for the best, because if the screen breaks - a high probability - you're out of luck."
"Amazon" "Some wifi connections problems, need to restart frequently (bug), too lazy to complete and receive a call and problems to recognize memory cards. in my opinion it is an expensive cell and full of problem."
"Amazon" "I have problems of connectivity with this phone. I use it for my work ,  I am very dissatisfied with the performance of it"
"Amazon" "Love this phone! awesome display it'll shipped promptly."
"Amazon" "Small gap on the front bit of the screen placement."
"Amazon" "Great product"
"Amazon" "Great phone"
"Amazon" "Great phone very nice, i like it thank you amazonYes i will recommand this site to my friends and family thanks again."
"Amazon" "Great phone!"
"Amazon" "Best phone I have had in years."
"Amazon" "I like this size,in addition it reaally nice !!!I bought a very cute case for it"
"Amazon" "Great phone original and truly work worldwide even in my country (honduras)"
"Amazon" "The screen on this phone is something to be desired by all. It has a beautiful screen that can display the phenomenal pictures this phone takes. It is a fast and reliable product. I highly recommend this phone!"
"Amazon" "cool"
"Amazon" "very nice phone for the great price."
"Amazon" "Awesome!! Im so happy everything came Perfect!! I was so nervous ive nevee bought a phone off amazon .

"Amazon" "Excelent"
"Amazon" "Great Phone! Thin, light, awesome Android implementation."
"Amazon" "Caribbean users....check your 4G/LET frequency with this phone.  Otherwise great phone."
"Amazon" "Love it.....bought it for the wife...want one too!!"
"Amazon" "It is beautiful everything is working as expected."
"Amazon" "The best phone money can buy in 2017. More like, you are buying a digital camera that also lets you speak on phone and chat on messengers."
"Amazon" "Awesome phone, no issue and satisfied"
"Amazon" "It has crashed a lot and I still do not understand why the screen stays on while charging"
"Amazon" "Camera lose focus. Lot of users claiming for the same issue."
"Amazon" "Bought from Samsung. Samsung messed up my order.The phone itself has buggy software, locks up or has lagging graphics, even for the most basic things.It's also very easy to slip off your hand. The on-screen home button sucks."
"Amazon" "Camera is just amazing. Great phone"
"Amazon" "Excellent phone. Love it. I made a great choice. Highly recommended. Love the color too."
"Amazon" "Ordered maple gold housing and received a silver casing."
"Amazon" "Very delighted with the phone, it works all the design the screen are very pretty"
"Amazon" "Graduating this year hopefully someone will gibe me one of these as a gift i been stuck with the same old Lg for 3 years now.if any one has a spare phone pls replay to my review"
"Amazon" "Camera is all blurry and phone works like crap.... do not buy from this user."
"Amazon" "Although dubbed as \"International Version\", it still came with a SD processor (i.e. SM-G950U1). Fast and fluid web browsing and app switching experience. Bixby isn't too bad either, once you learn _how_ to talk to her."
"Amazon" "It is awesome I found no problem with it"
"Amazon" "Good Day, I am very disaapointed, I bought the Maple Gold, I open the box and realise it's Arctic Silver, this is very disappointing. I should get some sort of compensation."
"Amazon" "It gets hot easly. The camera is not good as a samsung. Its china version."
"Amazon" "Exactly what I wanted!!"
"Amazon" "I never wanted to buy a phone online, for fear of a fake phone but I closed my eyes and ordered it...this S8 is great thanx for not skrewing me over..haha 5star"
"Amazon" "Was a fake dont buy"
"Amazon" "Note: I am reviewing this phone based on its quality and functionality, and it's full suggested retail price of $750, and not based on price-gouging from these third-party re-sellers.A quick prologue: I had been laying low since buying two Samsung Galaxy S6 Edges in early 2015 (one gold, one white - yes, I loved it that much). I knew that it was the perfect phone for me at that time, and that based on how the cell phone evolution was going on then (early 2015), I knew the S7 Edge would be an iterative succession, and not a big leap forward. So I bought my S6 Edges with the thought in mind that I would have it for at least 2-3 years. My analysis was that Samsung at that point in time had plateaued their curved screen technology and philosophy, and would move on next to foldable screens by 2020. I gave them a couple of buffer years in case they didn't feel like introducing us to such drastic technology too early, as Samsung has a habit of forward thinking, yet holding back a year or two so they can milk the most money out of their current technologies. Fast forward to this year, and I have not been wrong - Samsung has indeed matured and plateaued its curved screen plans, but their foldable screen technology has not been up to speed, so it would be delayed for another year or two (they are still on track for 2020). With the introduction and quick adoption/popularity of HDR technology, they can afford to stay on their curved screen plan for another year or two until they lower the costs of their foldable screen technology down enough for mass production.I loved my S6 Edges, but I got bored of the gold one quickly, and sold it to buy a Rose Gold iPhone 6S last year, while keeping the white S6 Edge. I loved everything about it - mainly the beautiful curved screen design, but even more so, the awesome camera, which was the best for its time, and still holds up today as one of the very best in bright light. If you go through my reviews, 99% of the photos from 2015 on are from my S6 Edge. It is so good I have replaced my travel DSLR with it (I still use my Canon 5D Mark III for my serious projects), and all my Instagram photos are also from my S6 Edge (you can find the link to my IG on my Amazon profile).Sorry for the long intro, but it ties to my review that the camera on the S8 is even better. Do not be fooled by early hands-on articles that the rear camera is the same as the S7 Edge. It is NOT the same. It is a new camera system developed by Sony, and it is a dual-pixel system which takes two photos each time you press the shutter button, and quickly and deftly combines the two to give you an awesome final photo, which contains HDR and selective focus elements/photo modes. It excels in low light conditions, with its f1.7 aperature, and it even exceeds the S7 Edge's camera. It might not compete in fast action with the ridiculous 960 fps Sony camera in its new Xperia X phones, but for everyday use, I feel this is the best phone camera so far. It has electronic image stabilization (EIS), even up to 4K video recording, which is a first for phone cameras. The front (selfie) camera is also vastly improved, but not as good as the 13MP camera of the LG G6.This is a photography geek's review, leading in with the camera, but I know most of you are more concerned with the big beautiful screen, which it is exactly that. The resolution is 2960 x 1440 pixels, or a pixel density of 570 ppi. The technology is Samsung's very own OLED, called sAMOLED. It is the same basic technology that makes the best TV screens in LG's OLED TVs. Samsung's 2017 version is so good, it is apparently the best screen ever. You can read more technical specs from Display Mate:displaymate. com/Galaxy_S8_ShootOut_01.htm (erase the space between the dot com)How Samsung has managed to squeeze all that goodness into a phone this size is quite a technological marvel, and quite a gamble as well. Instead of the 16:9 ratio 95% of the phones out there today have, they have chosen on a 18:5.9 ratio, which just sounds really weird. This is pretty much a 3:1 ratio, which is quite unheard of. Even LG's unique G6 phone has a different 18:9 (or 2:1) ratio. So this is Samsung's way of truly trying to stand out from the crowd for this generation (year). I really don't know why they chose this ratio, as even cinema (movie theatre) ratio is 21:9, so there truly is no video/film format that perfectly fits this screen's ratio. So there will be empty spaces around the videos and movies you watch, but the black bezels will help eliminate that disparity - note that all S8's, regardless of what color scheme, have black front bezels.This phone is actually more narrow than the S6/S6 Edge. The S8 measures 68.1mm wide by 8.1mm thick by 148.9mm tall, and weighs 155 grams, while the S6 Edge is 70.1 x 7 x 142.1 mm, and weighs 132 g. But as you can see it is a tick thicker, and noticeable taller and heavier. So although the S8 has a total footprint that is larger than the S6 Edge, or is actually easier and more comfortable to hold in one hand. For further comparisons, the iPhone 7 is 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1 mm (138 g), the iPhone 7 Plus is 158.2 x 77.9 x 7.3 mm (188 g), and the LG G6 is 148.9 x 71.9 x 7.9 mm (163 g). So it actually is easier to grasp in the hand than most other phones of similar size, only bested by the (much smaller) iPhone 7 (4.7-inch screen vs. 5.8-inch for the S8).The sound systems are also improved, as the speaker is louder and more clear, and the audio processing is much much better for listening to music with your earphones/headphones. However, it is still a mono speaker, not even stereo-immersive sound, and of course nowhere near as good as HTC's usual dual-speakers. Speaking of earphones, a pair of premium AKG earphones are included, which is the best factory-bundled earphones I have witnessed. It cannot compare to my Velodynes and Sennheisers, but it beats all other cheap generic bundled earphones. That reminds me, you should spend the extra $100 on the extra bundle, which in addition to the included VR headset, also includes a Samsun 256GB microSD card, and a pair of AKG Bluetooth headphones. Each sells for over $100, so you are actually saving a bunch: AKG Bluetooth Headphone Black (Y50BTBLK) Samsung EVO+ 256GB UHS-I microSDXC U3 Memory Card with Adapter (MB-MC256DA/AM).My S6 Edge worked fluidly and flawlessly in the first few month. But even with the top processor of the time, and 3GB of RAM, it slowed down as the memory neared the capacity, especially after the hundreds of photos began to pile up. The camera, once near instantaneous to turn on, now takes about a second. The S8, with its 4GB of RAM and either the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor or Samsung's own Exynos 8895 so far is doing an impeccable job. The Snapdragon 821, and even the 820, is fast enough for 2017, so having the 835 and the Exynos 8895 future-proofs it for another 2-3 years at least, since I feel with each successive processor, we are getting to the point where the hardware requirements for software is plateauing, and you would only need the latest processors for video games which keeps getting better and better and continually needs the fastest processor. I think once we reach 6GB of RAM, any processor beyond the 835/8895 should be fast enough for every day apps of the next 10 years.In totality, this is the first phone since the S6 Edge that I got really excited about, and with the rumored OLED iPhone coming out this year, 2017 should be a great year for fans of both sides to upgrade. If you don't mind the $750+ price, you can't go wrong with the Samsung Galaxy S8. It is an investment that should last a few years, or at least until those foldable screen phones come out...."
"Amazon" "Excellent"
"Amazon" "Very good no issues!"
"Amazon" "The phone is most likely a fake.  i got the phone for travel purposes.  the international phone is dual sim . this is not.  also it does not seem to have a lot of the bands used in europe and asia.  There is no warranty .  and by the time i returned more than 30 days from purchase.  so essentially you get swindled."

"Amazon" "Don’t like it... got bored of it after two days, system smoothness no match for an iPhone. Even worse than huawei phones. No more Samsung until they fix the software... many apps doesn’t take advantage of the display, and many apps just simply look for well optimized on iOS devices... in the end, it’s a Korean phone... who likes Korea yo..."
"Amazon" "good quality"
"Amazon" "Seriously, don't buy this phone. The bubble screen just makes finding a good, and sturdy screen protector on it difficult. It's just an ascetic thing and adds nothing to the phone. Secondly it doesn't take a standard micro USB port. There's a reason people buy android phones, to stay away from stupid niche's like that. The side bar app thing they show as a selling point is also pointless, it's another stupid feature they add to make this phone \"look\" like they've added something new from the older phones. But in reality it's just the same as having certain apps in a folder on your wallpaper. Don't waste your money on this phone, don't let Samsung think that it's ok to make people buy certain chargers just so they can get extra money from you or leave your screen vulnerable to damages so you have to buy insurance on it, or a new phone."
"Amazon" "Great"
"Amazon" "very good cell phone, it is better than iphone that I had used"

"Amazon" "Ok"
"Amazon" "DO NOT BUY. No where on the phone does it say s8 it says \"duos\", seems like fake material, even thought it is a \"international verison\", it is still suppose to be samsung. The headphones are from a akg company which  is not real samsung, the phone camera quality is terrible my old note 3 has better quality."
"Amazon" "Good product, still geting to know it."
"Amazon" "Excellent. Cannot take my hands off it"
"Amazon" "working good so far"
"Amazon" "This is the worst phone I've ever had.  I had a screen protector and case on it and the screen shattered really bad when I dropped it.  I dropped my S5 all the time and it was always fine.  This breaks ridiculously easy.  The screen being so big and on the sides makes stuff open all the time that you don't want to open.  I'm getting rid of it and getting a cheap phone.  Huge waste of money."

"Amazon" "I've been using my cell for two and a half months and the camera auto focus system suddenly stopped working. It wont focus either on normal camera o selfie camera, I have to tap the phone in order for it to focus. I am very disappointed with this problem."

"Amazon" "Bugs, bugs, bugs... from the pulldown notification menu not pulling down properly, to the extreme lack of screen touch sensitivity, im really wishing id have waited for the new iphone. Very overpriced, very substandard...Still disappointed. I've had the phone a month and I've decided i am never buying another Samsung product again.Just got the update, no difference in user experience. We pay too much money for these things to keep getting crap. For what it's worth the iPhone will be incredibly overpriced as well. We need a more relevant third option."
"Amazon" "Fake af"
"Amazon" "I'm into material things. Hood rich on a payment plan. This phone is a debt worth having. It does everything even stuff I didn't think I needed.  I dropped a star because,  Bixby is a waste  still using Google assistant."
"Amazon" "Okay. First one broke second day of use, RIGHT in the morning! First drop, concrete, shattered - and one small crack = dead phone. Because the darn thing is needlessly ENTIRELY GLASS, and virtually NO edges, any cracks splinter across the whole phone. Cracks in the middle (mine was ONLY on the right \"infinity\" edge area) cripple all touch sensors above the middle, so I could only dial numbers, not use the keypad even trying to get the phone fixed.The insurance company REFUSES to replace these; they found every excuse to prevent me getting a replacement for 10 DAYS! I demanded Sprint make it right, but, as nice as Sprint support is, the insurance company they use is a bag of D's. RUDE! They even accused me in the end of phone insurance fraud. WTF!? So I left Sprint for T-Mobile on principal and paid the remaining $700 balance for the STILL DEAD PHONE.Second phone (first with TMobile) survived about a week and a half. It was about the second drop, just about 2 feet off the ground IN A PROTECTIVE CASE! Looking at it right now. I knew all phone carriers have the same insurance, so I've decided to just get a Samsung J7; basically a Note 4 without the stylus. Since I'm looking at my Note 4, which as slight scratches on the screen, and some metal ripped off the side from drops, it still works perfectly, I'm glad to have a cheaper phone I don't mind so much  breaking, and will eventually file a claim with TMobile, once I can stomach the concept of dealing with that insurance company again.I love Samsung, but I HATE this phone! It's only brought me misery, and $1400 dollars down the toilet.Also, side note, no current phone repair places can fix this, because of the \"inifinity\" screen junk,"
"Amazon" "WTH!!! The phone I recieved does not have bixby voice. SCAM!"
"Amazon" "Everything OK"
"Amazon" "👍"
"Amazon" "Happy with my purchase. This is by far the best phone ive ever bought."
"Amazon" "amazing!!!"
"Amazon" "No problems, product as described and as expected. 👌"
"Amazon" "Phone does not work with Verizon, it does work with T-Mobile. Unfortunately you will find out after  going through the pain of trying to set the device up."
"Amazon" "Its Okkk..Not Good Result"
"Amazon" "Truchada total"
"Amazon" "Good, very successfull!"
"Amazon" "Cant use it. Verizon cant open it! Beautiful thing but useless if you want a phone."
"Amazon" "This carrier is not good."
"Amazon" "The device is awesome"
"Amazon" "The phone was not compatible with my Verizon Wireless contract. Doesn't seem to work with Verizon's US network. had to return the phone and purchase a different one"
"Amazon" "What a gimmick for an upgrade."
"Amazon" "I HATE THIS PHONE!!!!! It takes 20 hours to charge via USB-C on computer or Car, it will only charge fast if connected to a wall, and takes 2 hours to charge. It also loses battery like crazy, after 15 min I'm down 5% doing nothing and only loaded 3 apps."
"Amazon" "I love the new Nintendo. Great button feel and colors for my grandson. Would definitely recommend for other people looking for gifts for their grandkids! Glad I finally found one on amazon, these were too hard to find at Target and Wal-Mart."
"Amazon" "i thought i was buying a dual-sim version - i got a single-sim instead"
"Amazon" "devise is good but they charged me $200 extra for delivery."
"Amazon" "I want for metro pcs?"
"Amazon" "nice phone"
"Amazon" "SAMSUNG  s-u-c-k-s so bad WHY!!!! one reason one they start  with there announcement  they start to say the release date is not going to work  properly  that why the previews  one we decided festive by charging  it to much they off on fire or may because they just want you money I rather get a Sony CELLPHONE  much  better  they tested before  they about  to announce  it on TV and say what store are they are going  to  be sold at..."
"Amazon" "BUYER BEWARE! WORST PHONE EVER!"
"Amazon" "If I can give zero star I will"
"Amazon" "My wife loves her new phone.  This is definitely an improvement over previous models."
"Amazon" "The only problem I have is that when I am talking not using Bluetooth or speaker, the person on the other side can bearally hear you. So I  always have to use the speaker or Bluetooth."
"Amazon" "I was very hesitant about purchasing a refurbished phone because you never know what you're going to get. I was pleasantly surprised when my phone came and it was in perfect condition. I was able to put my Verizon sim card in and was able to connect and go.The only reason I chose Mango (the seller) was because of their 100% feedback for the last 6 months.The phone is great and is better than I thought it could be."
"Amazon" "Samsung Galaxy S8 64GB, Arctic Silver - Verizon + GSM Factory Unlocked 4G LTE (Certified Refurbished) the product page reads \"The product ships with relevant accessories,\" and my phone arrived in a generic package with the phone, USB type-C cable, and wall charger.I contacted the seller to clarify that \" this does not include all available accessories. All refurbished units will ship with only an MFI-certified charging cable and UL-listed power adapter, headphones, manuals, etc. are not included.\" The customer service is nice and wonderful.I now have spent a good amount of time on the phone, and I am glad that I got this phone.Plus, my friends with iPhones are now thinking of switching to such a nice deal."
"Amazon" "Already knew the S8+ and loved it. I ordered this to replace one I broke. This came in awesome condition. I'm subtracting 2 stars because it did NOT have the latest update as advertised and for that reason it initially did not want to set up with my TMobile sim. It kept complaining that it wasn't Verizon and wanted to be in \"global\" mode. When it would connect, it was so slow it was unusable. I figured out the solution though. I stuck a Verizon sim from my work phone(you could also just be on wifi, but Verizon prioritized the updates pushed to it), let it do all the updates and then put my TMobile sim in. Then it detected it was TMobile, cleared out the crappy Verizon bloatware and everything is fine! Hope this helps others having issues.Seller should include this info as well as actually do full updates after factory reset as advertised."
"Amazon" "Can't really imagine a way this could have been much better. The phone shipped in a box. Not original packaging, but something nice just to keep it safe and whatever. The phone looks like the screen was replaced because it had a protective plastic over it which very easialy peeled off to reveal a phone in flawless condition. From front to back, bezel to bezel. There was barely a trace of anything that would indicate the phone was pre-owned. I felt like I got very lucky with my purchase.This is the third refurbished/ pre-owned phone I've bought and it follows the trend of having a charger and a cable (usually one which seems used and not in great condition) My cable was slightly nicer than the ones I got with other phones but I'm sure that's just by chance. It was still obviously a used cable which had issues keeping a solid connection to my computer. Again, I think all these companies do this so I don't think it's the end of the world. The actual wall charger is an official Samsung one and that was basically the reason this wasn't a 4 star review. Even though the cable isn't very good, the phone charges quickly which is the whole point.This also came with a key to open the sim slot. Since the phone had some power when it was shipped, I had this Verizon phone making calls on ATT in about 30 minutes from the time I opened the box.I really feel like these guys are trying to be competitive in how they ship and present their products as well as what kind of accessories they come with. I will definitely look for these guys the next time I need a phone."
"Amazon" "The phone was in good condition. Came in a small box with a charger and device. Had a smaller-than-screen film covering on the display screen but I was okay with that. BUT, the phone came with the wrong charger. Galaxy S8 uses a Type C usb charger but it came with the regular galaxy charger. So I couldn't charge the phone for a few days, and had to order another charger. So... I wouldn't say this is the perfect deal."
"Amazon" "TO GSM OWNERS this does work with it. You just need to tinker with the settings slightly.Go to your settingsThen1) go to mobile networks2) network mode---GSM3) Go to network operators and click what service you own (at least for at&t)Great phone, would've been fooled if you told me it was brand new. Just a little worrying when it says \"not a verizon SIM card.\" But passed that mini heart attack, and it's a great deal"
"Amazon" "Phone works perfectly. Never bought a Certified Refurbished item from Amazon before and I'm very impressed with the purchase. Seems to be brand new. Love it."
"Amazon" "Awesome phone I was very impressed with this certified refurbished device. Would definitely recommend. Also keep in mind it is a verizon phone. But it is. I repeat. IT IS UNLOCKED. I have it with metro pcs and it works awesome. I was at one of the metro pcs stores and was told i couldn't activate it with them. I went to a different metro pcs store and was helped right away and walked out with the phone connected. My advice would be to tell the workers its unlocked and that the phone is fully paid off. Most of the workers there are kinda lazy and tend not to care at all if its not a phone from their carrier."
"Amazon" "So on my college that likes to use the speech function on my phone to write things. But half the time it doesn't work and I cant get rid of the noise that it makes when I use it. I now this is a software issue but the phone I upgraded from had a better time recognizing my voice and works every time. I feel that it has to do a lot with this push to use Bixby but that no excuse to have worse performance. BTW the phone I upgraded from was the Samsung Galaxy Note 3(a phone from 2013). But besides that it's great and has worked to the top of it potential."
"Amazon" "Very happy with the purchase!! Good job. #maga"
"Amazon" "This review is coming from someone that is rather biased so take it as you will, but there are some points I want to bring up that hopefully you'll all consider. The reason I say I'm biased is because I enjoy using compact phones (4.7 inches) and it was an inconvenience to try to use this phone. There were three main issues that I had with this phone and that was the first one. Along with that, the aspect ratio is just awkward and it was weird to try to watch movies on the screen. The second issue I had is the fact that you can't put a screen protector on this phone without losing the phones receptiveness to touch. This is something that I had no idea about before I actually purchased the phone - no major reviewer talked about it. But as soon as I had a tempered glass screen protector installed, I had to tap the screen an average of about five times before it would register my touch. First I installed a screen protector myself from Amazon and it had that issue, and I thought it was just that specific screen protector, so I went to the mall and got one installed from a professional. It had the same issues. Also, it defeats the purpose of having an edge to edge curved screen if you want to use a case. So really this is a great phone for someone that's fine with not protecting their phone, but for me, someone that needs to protect their investment, the fear of dropping the phone was unbearable. The last issue I had with this phone is the fact that it was having issues with certain apps crashing and not being able to use some apps - most likely due to the fact that the phone is refurbished. For example, I was able to get my banking app set up just fine the first day, then the next day, and all the following days, it would crash immediately after opening it. There were some other apps that did that as well like some games and online dating apps. For me that was the last straw and I ended up returning the phone. It was also very hard to get in touch with the seller themselves over the phone because they have to actually pick up the phone and if they don't you have to leave a voicemail, unlike how most phone systems are set up where if you call you'll get someone on the phone eventually if you stay on the line. Out of the about twenty times I tried to get in touch with them, they only picked up once. When I finally did get on the phone with someone from BuySpry, she seemed very disinterested in talking to me and didn't seem to care about my concerns. I myself work in a customer support job, and if one of my co-workers acted like that, they would eventually end up getting fired. The good news however is that if you send them an email it only takes them about a day to respond. The only reason I gave this two stars instead of one stars is because I was able to get a full refund after I returned the phone. As a last thought with this review, do yourself a favor: if you want to buy a flagship phone, don't buy it refurbished. If you buy it refurbished, it comes with the risk of having software issues like mine did, and you essentially get half the life of a brand new phone. So really you're getting maybe $100 off to have a worse battery life, about half a lifespan of the phone itself, and a risk of software issues. I would easily pay an extra $100 to not have those issues. You owe it to yourself to buy a phone new if you're going to buy a flagship."
"Amazon" "This went way better than I had expected. The phone was in a pristine state. There was a little instruction card to get me started with the setup, which was helpful because that can be a little different than for a boxed phone. A google search helped with other queries, like how to start the system update check etc.There was a white charger in the box, and no other accessories. (the value of these would be no more than 10-12 dollars even at retail prices).So ultimately, I got a beautiful like-new phone, at a hefty discount, that pretty much meant I got an S8 at the price of a Oneplus 5. I allowed myself to feel smug for a few days. :)"
"Amazon" "Great product,came well packed. No scratches and worked perfectly. 10/10"
"Amazon" "phone came in excellent condition and worked perfectly only problem is that since it is Verizon if you want to update you need to download the samsung smart connect app onto your computer to update the software and that they sent a micro usb cable instead of a usb c cable."
"Amazon" "Phone was packaged well and works as expected. It did not include all of the accessories. It came with the charger but no headphones. The description says that it would come complete but that the accessories may be different brands than the ones that you get from Samsung. It is disappointing to not receive everything that you should with your order."
"Amazon" "Is not reading my T-mobile SIM card."
"Amazon" "It is not GSM unlocked. Does not work with AT&T."
"Amazon" "The phone wasn’t unlock they give fake information about it i pay a lot of money to unlock it"
"Amazon" "I upgraded from the iPhone 7 plus and I must say the S8+ is light years ahead! I've had every iPhone for the past 7 years and this phone blows any iPhone outta the water (just have to adjust to android OS) Charges in 1/2 the time, battery last 2x longer with 13 hours with heavy use! Screen is bigger, brighter, more vibrabt and feels alot smaller in hand despite having a bigger screen. Camera takes better selfies (wider range and more detail)No more over priced apple products for me!"
"Amazon" "Received this phone yesterday (as a gift same model number 955f) and have been using it with Simple Mobile and T Mobile networks here in the United States. Put my sim card in and got good connections with LTE, no problems."
"Amazon" "If you bought a Samsung S8+, you now have Bixby, a piece of bloatware written by a group of teenagers tasked by Samsung with imitating Google Now, Alexa, Cortana, and Siri. The result is absolutely catastrophic and reminds of Word 1.0 (if you are old enough). The software still does not recognize voice – no, it’s not just because of my accent – making it perfectly useless.The catch is that this “assistant” – which would be called Jar Jar Binks if it was from a galaxy far far away – is tied to a side button. As soon as the S8 was released, people came up with Google Play applications to remap this button or to disable the software altogether. Samsung retaliated by releasing an update to prevent the hack from working. It lasted for a week until a clever developer found a countermeasure.One million people have downloaded one of the anti-Bixby programs on Google Play. The other Samsung S8 users are probably trying to figure how to do it, I guess. Well done, Samsung! You have released another Galaxy Note 7...So, I will now give you a way to BOTH disable the pathetic Bixby AND remap the button.1. Download “Package Disabler Pro”2. Search for the Bixby software in \"Package Disabler Pro\" and disable all EXCEPT Bixby Home and Bixby Voice. They will be rendered harmless without the services except that they detect the button press and raise an event. You can disable the rest of the Samsung bloatware while you’re at it.3. Install the BxAction software from Google Play4. The BxAction software detects the raised event from step 2 and it will be able to start another app.5. Map the button to something useful like Google Now (which is a piece of software that actually does what Samsung advertises Bixby for...)"
"Amazon" "Good product and Excellent service."
"Amazon" "The product was only one day late due to delivery times by the post office, but after receiving the phone and discovering all of it's capabilities, what came along with the package, along with other features was worth that one day waiting period. Thanks Wireless|Place for a nice product."
"Amazon" "Great phone"
"Amazon" "just amazing love it got it yesterday and can't stop playing with it :)"
"Amazon" "This item has a set of improvement have been incorporated as per experience of old samsung series. Particularly, it is the best for me."
"Amazon" "Un gran equipo ,recomendado"
"Amazon" "Fast and amazing battery life."
"Amazon" "all right product of the highest quality."
"Amazon" "Very satisfied about this phone"
"Amazon" "Best phone ever"
"Amazon" "Nice phone"
"Amazon" "Excellent Phone I place my T mobile Sim and it run with no problems, The phone came seal never opened. Excellent"
"Amazon" "It's a VERY NICE PHONE!!, unfortunately the one I bough after 15-20 days developed a camera failure: \"Warning Camera Fail\". And here is the second problem... WARRANTY IS ONLY VALID IN THE U.S.!!!, Samsung it's not like Apple, Samsung warranty is local on phones so forget it you think Samsung will accept your warranty elsewhere. I went to Samsung Colombia and their preliminary analysis is that they are not sure if the problem is with the camera (70% probability) or the board.  At this time I have not yet decided if sending  the phone to US for warranty or take it to Samsung Colombia at my own expense. If the hardware problem is with the camera, the replacement will cost me like US$100-150.  Because I saved US$350  buying the phone in US,  it still makes a good deal and the camera replacement will give me a year of warranty on phone's camera in Colombia.Beware because this \"Warning Camera Fail\" error its a very commune HARDWARE issue on the S8/S8+ models. I have bough several Samsung phones, they are excellent and will buy Samsung again... I just wasn't lucky with this one.The phone works perfectly well in Colombia (GSM-LTE 4G), it gets the updates on time. I have not taken it to other countries yet."
"Amazon" "I have this Galaxy S8+ working under the Cricket carrier.The fingerprint scanner on the back is a non-issue.  It took me no time to become accustomed to it.  Using it is even easier after putting a case on the phone.The S8+ is noticeably better than the S7 and can handle anything you throw at it.  It is a beast at multi-tasking.  If only apps were as well designed as this phone, it's annoying when they crash or freeze because of imperfections in their coding.  If you have problems with apps glitching or crashing, it's the app, not this powerful phone that can stand toe-to-toe with desktop computers.UPDATE July 4, 2017:I no longer have this phone, it went defective on me.Exactly a month after buying it, the screen blacked out while I was laying on the couch watching a Twitter video. Everything was responsive, the screen just wouldn't light up. I ended up returning it just in time. Now I have the Galaxy S7 again. If you get this expensive phone, you should get some type of insurance on it.  This expensive phone taught me that no phone is safe from defects. This one comes with a one-year warranty, but I don't know how thorough it is. When you get the phone, you have a certain amount of time to sign up with Samsung Premium Care. I think Amazon has an insurance package too so you should compare both of them before choosing either of them.Now that I'm back on the Galaxy S7, I'm reminded of how this phone is a still a beast too."
"Amazon" "Fantastic phone. What I've come to expect from Samsung.  Screen size with more to view and with an S-View  Case it is the best so far."
"Amazon" "This phone is a great device so filled with bloat wear it's practically useless.  It's the most aggravating device I've ever used.  I'll never buy a Samsung phone again and I wish I bought another Google phone - pure Android, no junk apps.Bixby, Samsung's answer to OK Google, Alexa or Siri is the worst AI.  It's constantly prompting you and can never respond to your simple requests.  \"I'm sorry but I cannot do that\" is its response to most every routine request.  The auto-correct is obnoxious and changes words without warning.  The phone is also constantly trying to teach you how to use it by popping up tutorials you cannot close without completing.  Sorry but I've used a camera before I don't need forced tutorials.  And you cannot turn any of this off.  Bixby is there to sell you things so enjoy paying $750 for high pressure sales.  I could go on and on but I think you get the point.I really regret this purchase."
"Amazon" "Overall the Galaxy S8 is an excellent smartphone that competes and often one ups other current flagship phones (Google Pixel, iPhone).  Ultimately a few odd design decisions keep this from achieving a full 5 star review from me.PROS-The best looking screen on any mass market phone ever produced-Excellent camera performance-Lighter version of Touchwiz (Samsung OS) including the ability to disable and uninstall bloatware-Not too big to hold (a bit long though)-Solid battery performanceCONS-Odd positioning of a dedicated button for \"Bixby\" Samsung's assistant software.  This button is far too close to the volume down button and I hit it constantly by accident.  Worse yet, it can't be disabled without downloading a third party app.  Even worse, Bixby itself is not anywhere near as useful as Google assistant.  Samsung...PLEASE stop messing with software.  Leave Google alone, this is their core business competency and your incessant layering on of useless features (now coming with a dedicated button) is obscene.  This design flaw will ultimately drive me to a Google Pixel upon their next release (most likely Fall 2017).-Odd positioning of the fingerprint sensor.  Way too far up on the phone which makes it hard to reach, right next to the camera lens.  Bad design.-Fragile glass.  I dropped it from between knee and waist height one time and the glass cracked.  If you buy, you must invest in a screen protector.Ultimately if you can deal with the annoyances listed above you should have no reservations buying this phone.  The screen itself is worth the investment.  Every time I show someone a photo on my camera they comment on how good it looks.  Here's to hoping Samsung scratches the Bixby button, embeds the finger print reader in the screen, and offers a pure Android version.  That to me would be the perfect phone."
"Amazon" "My wife and I have had the Samsung S8+ for a little over a week now. I am an avid Samsung Galaxy user, and have been using them since the 4th generation. Here are the pros and cons as I see them to this device.Pros:- Android Nougat is a very smooth OS. It's a definite upgrade from the previous versions. Just keeps getting better.- The cameras on this phone are both amazing. Makes great photos!- Very slick design on phone, aesthetically speaking. It looks very nice.- Comes with a nice variety of accessories, including adapters for charging in case you want to use a micro-USB charger or want to hook up a USB cable accessory for any reason.- Extremely good graphics on this device. Resolution is phenomenal.- Wide range of settings for customizing your user experience and security. (Even more than the usual for an Android/Samsung device)- Continued to allow for external storage, unlike the S6, which made me very happy.- I haven't put the water resistance to the test, but I'm assuming it's as good as the last model. Glad it's there.- The full screen layout is very nice for movies and gaming. I adjusted to the homescreen button being part of the screen almost instantly.Cons:- This is an EXTREMELY fragile design, especially the back of the phone, which is also coated in the Gorilla Glass, from what I can tell. My wife dropped hers from about 10 inches, with a case on, on the 5th day of ownership. The back of the phone cracked, chipped, and spider-webed all over within just a few hours. The phone was insured through our carrier, but the cheapest solution was to send it in to Samsung for a $75 repair job (plus shipping and handling). I would strongly recommend using a reputable case and screen protector at all costs. And be sure you insure this device. Lots of the durability tests that I have seen on YouTube have exposed this design flaw as well.- The headphones that come with the phone aren't that great. In previous editions, they provided Samsung-brand headphones that sounded great. It looks like they've started using another company to produce their headphones. There is very little bass or mid-range in the sound, so if you use your headphones for music, gaming, or videos, be prepared to get a better brand.- The new Bixby application via Samsung... I'm still trying to adjust to it. It's Samsung's version of Google Assistant/Siri. It's not that it's not a useful concept, but you don't get much of a choice but to use it. There's a dedicated button on the left of the phone that can not be deactivated from what I can tell. It's right below the volume button and is easy to press unknowingly and can get annoying quickly. I hope Bixby grows on me.- The voice command features for both Google and Bixby is weak in this edition. I have had to reprogram my voice recognition settings about 5 times already, and it still only picks up the commands about 30% of the time. Oddly enough, it works much better for the Bixby service than the Google Assistant service. (That struck me as a bit suspicious)- The speech-to-text application in general took a step backwards with this edition. My S7 and S6 both did a wonderful job for the most part of translating my speech. This phone, however, has massive errors in its translation. It hyphenates words that don't need to be and substitutes words incorrectly, and often. I have to speak EXTREMELY slowly and phonetically in order to get it to work. The fact that I have a Southern accent doesn't help whatsoever. This was one of the worst drawbacks for me, personally, because I use the speech-to-text feature often with my work.Overall: It's a gorgeous phone with some definite upgrades but concerning drawbacks. If I were Samsung, I would put a lot of emphasis on making a more durable design on the future editions. Worth buying - just keep it well protected."
"Amazon" "I pre ordered my Samsung S8 and received on April 20,2017 from AT&T. I really liked the look and the screen was wonderful. But I have an issue and it is a buyer beware thing. This phone has gorilla glass 5 on it which is suppose to be the best. The other day I had my phone in my front pocket and bent down. the phone dropped out and landed on the ground face down. Now it was only 10\"-12\" from the ground and when it occurred I said, \"damn\" to myself but remembered it had gorilla glass 5 on it so not a problem. Later on looking at the phone I saw a scratch and on further inspection it revealed a crack that went across the phone 3 ways. I have had a Samsung 4 and 6 and never had a problem with a screen when they dropped before. So beware for the gorilla glass is not all cracked up to what they are saying. To say the least I am disappointed at Samsung creating a top notch phone with a screen that is so easily damaged. I love this phone but can not recommend because of the poorly designed screen on this phone."
"Amazon" "It works great with T-mobile and AT&T and Cricket, battery can last me whole day or up to 7 or 8 pm."
"Amazon" "Great phone. However, it DOES NOT work with Verizon. This is supposed to be an international phone, but I've spent over 3 hours with very helpful Verizon support people and we got some of it working but never the phone calls.Just in case, you want to use this in the USA, it will not work!"
"Amazon" "This looks like a great phone at first. After only a few weeks, I realized that I made a huge mistake to give Samsung a third chance (after owning a washer/dryer that died after only 4 years and a TV that came apart and had to be exchanged for a Sony TV after less than a week).First, Samsung's bloatware really ruins the experience. However, with sweat, blood, and tears you can remove most of it. You can even disable Bixby and turn your Galaxy S8+ into the first phone with a non-functional hardware button. However, you cannot have hands-free Google Assistant, even though Samsung advertises this feature.Second, the hardware is fragile. I had my phone in a Samsung case since day one and it still managed to get a deep long scratch on the back. I didn't drop it. It was never outside the case. It was not a third-party case. I'm not a savage. For example, I've never scratched any of my previous iPhones in the span of nearly a decade.Third, don't bother paying for or seeking support. You'll first talk to support that turns out to be volunteers, yet it is made to look like official Samsung support. Then you're given a phone number to call support and ten minutes into the call they mention Premium Support. You then respond with... \"Wait, your not Premium Support\" and they give you yet another number to call. So, you call Premium Support, which costs $288 for 2 years by the way, and are told that you have to pay the $99 deductible even in this case. I then learn that I'm actually talking to someone from Assurant who has zero flexibility. They tell me that they can connect me with Premium Support though. After several minutes I learn that there actually is no other Premium Support entity and that you're really just dealing with an inflexible insurance and that Samsung doesn't stand behind their products.I understand that there are a deductible and fine print but Samsung should also understand that I only do business with companies that stand behind the quality of their products. I didn't drop the phone or use it without a case. I used it with a Samsung case that ended up causing a scratch on the supposedly ultrastrong glass back. If it weren't for Apple's lackluster iPhone releases in the past 3 years I would've never given them a third chance. There will absolutely not be a fourth chance.You'll see this phone on Craigslist very soon and I'll be returning all my Samsung accessories over the weekend."
"Amazon" "I LOVE SAMSUNG GALAXY S8+ ."
"Amazon" "I am extremely impressed by the speed, fingerprint, audio, and phone function.  It is a very expensive phone, but it changes everything.  You will get voicemail notification instantly.  Everything is so fast.  I test the download speed with 4G lte, 20, and upload speed 15.  The software is so sleek, I did not experience any difficulty when set up printing with canon application.  This is my first time for real print from a phone to my canon printer.  All my apps runs better on this platform except videos.  The phone should be wider so that the video would run bigger on the screen.Over all, it is beautiful upgrade that is very expensive.  I am happy with this decision."
"Amazon" "I recently offered my Galaxy s8 plus to a loved one for a bargain price, intending to buy a Pixel 2 or Pixel 2 XL. A day later, I sheepishly reneged on my offer. Reason: neither the Pixel 2 nor the Note 8 nor any other Android contender could best this bad boy. Speed, size, display, camera, overall experience — No other phone can touch the s8 plus with the possible exception of iPhone X, and, as an owner of both who loves his iPhone X, I can’t see any reason for an Android user to switch platforms. My biz phone is iPhone, home phone is s8 Plus, and the 0nly tiebreaker is my Apple Watch 3 LTE. THAT is unrivaled, but if you’re wed to Android, the Samsung Gear 3 is pretty darned good. As regards phone design, Apple has caught up to Samsung with the X, but not convincingly passed it. I love both phones and couodnt part with my s8 plus even though I had promised it to a loved one and always (except when pardoned by a generous loved one) honor said promises!"
"Amazon" "\"Vishnu U at 13:46, Oct 6:I do understand you concern, but from our end we can only check the status of the ticket that was updated by the repair technicians, Carlos.\"Samsung has my phone for 20 daysThey do not repair International model, even if you purchase it in AMAZON.COM site...They give you a run around... SUPER, SUPER BAD DEALBe aware"
"Amazon" "I received this phone in 3 days after online order and hardly used it for 32 days when it broke down. The LCD started to have bright light on left edge on day 28 ( I did not realize it was an LCD problem and thought I had accidentally turned on some feature)  and by day 32 it progressively got worse and today day 33 the LCD is totally black , when I  turn it on the phone it vibrates but the screen stays black. I took it to the service center in Hyderabad  India but they said because I had bought it in the US the warranty did not apply.  I am very upset as I am here on an assignment and can not return to the US until Feb 20th. This is my first Samsung phone and I think I will never again buy another one. I have had Iphones before but never had such basic issues or such bad service."
"Amazon" "I've used cheap phones for the past several years but recently started my own business and find that I really use my phone enough for work to justify the higher expense so this review is from the perspective of someone who has been using the lower end Motorola phones for a while (most recently moto g4 play).Samsung has features and forces you to have apps you don't want, which I had forgotten about since the last time I had a Galaxy (probably first generation). The first thing I did is remove the auto updates on all of the apps I didn't want or need in the first place. Too bad I can't remove them.Ring tone defaults are weird and that's the second thing to fix. You also will have to set everything up so you are able to get your MMS messages since the phone comes unlocked, but I expected that.The screen is beautiful. Once I have it in a case, it's much larger than I expected, which is a good and bad thing. Sound quality has been good so far, but I typically talk through a Bluetooth (either headset or car speakers).One thing I did not realize is that this phone does not charge with the standard micro USB. It is not as inconvenient as I first thought because the adapters are readily available and cheap, so I'm just ordering several of them. I'll also give the wireless charger a try.I do think I'll learn to love this phone in time once I get used to all of the Samsung quirks again.Pros: Great picture, and easy to read/work on documents for work. Once it's organized and personalized, the layout makes sense like any android.Cons: different charger, stays lit all of the time (draining battery) to show the clock (although there might be a setting I haven't found to fix that)."
"Amazon" "-Nice screen.-Bixby seems like a flop.-Dumb location for the fingerprint scanner.  Even with a case, it is very awkward to use.-Finding a good screen protector for this phone is impossible due to the design of the screen.-Needs dual speakers.-Iris scanner is great, wish it was a tad faster.-Phone is fast, but iPhone still has grown of fastest phone-For the size of the phone, battery should have been 4,000 mAh-Overpriced.  Not groudbreaking enough for the high price; Samsung must think we are iSheep!"
"Amazon" "I have used iPhones for many years and I 've owned original iPhone, 3GS, 4s, 5s and 6s. I used only one Android phone (Nexus by Google) before and it was not so good product comparing to Apple's at that time. Android OS was laggy and glitchy, this Google phone using aftertaste was \"cheap\" comparing to Apple's \"polished and premium\".  After iPhone's X ridiculous price and humped screen was announced I have decided to give Samsung a chance and purchased this device.I use this phone for 3 weeks now and I am very surprised to see how many innovations is concentrated in this phone. Screen is great, camera is very good, battery is just wonderful. My last iPhone 6s could hold the charge for only half a day when used intensively, but this phone battery charge never felt below 25% after full day intensive use. And Bixby is  cool too.To be honest I think Apple is underdog now, they are selling nearly same phones squeezing money from old ideas and their strong brand. Currently I am very happy with my new Samsung S8+"
"Amazon" "Ordered this as a used item. Everything about it was New. Packaging, condition, etc.  Even though the phone was not designated with any carrier, it worked with Straight Talk and their AT and T Sims card. Impressed with features, speed and screen"
"Amazon" "I was initially a little hesitant to purchase my new S8+ from amazon, but I was pleasantly surprised at how smooth everything went. I received my device literally within 2-3 days of placing my order. For those confused about the difference between the international version and the us unlocked version I would like to offer some clarity. The main differences between the two are that on the international verison you may or may not be able to use Samsung Pay depending on your devices country of origin. You will not be able to utilize your carrier’s specific features like hd voice, WiFi calling etc. The international verison features Samsung’s exynos processor versus snapdragon. I use AT&T and my device works absolutely fine. The device I received had the model number SM-G955F which is the Spain version. As far as the actual performance of the device itself I am blown away, infinity display, blazing fast, excellent battery life I mean this is hands down the best smartphone money can buy."
"Amazon" "This phone is absolutely beautiful to hold and it has a sleek, 'new-car' feeling!Over all the functionality is similarly comparable across the Galaxy phones (4/7edge) with exception to few obvious changes (upgrades?) to the phone.  In the quest for the slick, they opted to take away the 'Home' button, which my fingers - as well as other iPhone/Galaxy users - have gotten subconsciously programmed to press, only to find that there are no buttons. I would need to 'swipe up' from the bottom of the screen and a virtual 'Home’ button, 'back' function and 'multi-window' interface becomes accessible.This phone has a Samsung Note8-esque interface (not to mention, the screen size difference between those two is just 0.1 inch!). So outside of the Stylus, S8+ promises to be just as versatile in its use!  One other function they did away with - because of the ‘Home’ button change - I have to use the Volume down+Power button to take a screenshot.  Using my thumb+middle finger to squeeze a shot may get some getting used to!The 3500mAh Battery holds well through the day (I use it heavily and I only seem to be down to about 35% by dinner time) and the only thing that seems to 'overheat' the product and/or shorten the battery life is when I am using it with VR.When I first had the Samsung S4, I was able to capture image of a beautiful low-light sunset (for which I was selected winner for a photography submission) and ever since then I’ve been HOOKED!  I took a photo of another sunset! This one was taken without any special filter and yet it beautifully captures the layers of the fading colors - S8+ exceeds it’s low-light capabilities of it's predecessors!  In addition, there are some new photo functions (swipe left in ‘Camera’). I love that as an inner (or Yelp) ‘Foodies’, I have my very own food filter to snap as many lunch or dinners as I pleased!  Use the 'Pro' function and I am Wow'd with the filter package it comes with!Getting an unlocked phone will give me the freedom to choose mobile network not just in the US but Internationally - which is great, as an international photographer to travel with and it sure beats carrying around multi handsets!  As an unlocked phone, this Samsung S8+ has both CDMA and GSM capabilities.  I went with a CDMA network, and the company blocked my ‘Talk and Surf’ function. On the bright side, CDMA does seem to preserve the battery life better so it’s a toss up!As the saying goes, ya either will Love it or Hate it, like Kimchee.  Take it from a diehard Macgirl that switched out of the iPhone to a Samsung.  It was worth it and haven’t gone back!   "
"Amazon" "everything works fine and the phone is what i expected. Im inlove with the S8 plus im soo happy with my phone."
"Amazon" "Purchased one though us cellular and there is not one thing about the phone I do not like. The camera is amazing takes great pictures even of betta fish in an aquarium. I have 4 fish and love to take pictures of them. With this phone I can take great pictures. I love the size, feel in my hands, I used the ear buds when I walk daily and they have awesome sound. The phone stays put in my hand when I'm walking. I have have dropped it and it's sturdy as he'll. Also I love the color orchard gray so beautiful."
"Amazon" "Bixby fail. before you purchase this phone do your research on Bixby. You are unable to turn it off or remap it. If you're not going to use this feature be prepared to constantly turn it off because Samsung deceitfully placed the launch button right under the volume button so your hands/fingers constantly hit it launching this under developed feature. Trust it will be come very frustrating every time you sleep your phone, put it in your pocket, take it out of your pocket or in general touch your phone. Terrible trickery. You've been warned."
"Amazon" "BUYER BEWARE:The Galaxy S8 and S8+ has extremely fragile glass.  There have been many metric tests that have shown the glass to be very vulnerable to cracking, not good for a all-glass phone.  The SquareTrade testing resulted in the worst performing glass they have ever tested.My wife and I are big Galaxy fans, and pre-ordered the phones even with the Note7 issues.  We loved the phones until last weekend when both phones ended up with cracks on the edge screens.  There were no drops, or collisions, or any single event we could point to for how these cracks happened.  Our best guess is the cracks were from being in our pockets (also the cracks are from tensional forces, not impact), and we weren't playing basketball or wrestling, simple walking around town and at home.  It was the fact we were so gentle with these phones that has us dumbfounded.  It was after this when I researched and found they very poor performances in reliability testing on the S8 glass.My wife's phone crack originated from the interface between the edge screen glass and the Bixby button, her screen is unresponsive in an isolated area around that crack.  My phone's crack is originated from the bottom-right corner, and the entire screen now is unresponsive.  I cannot unlock the phone or even power the phone down.I contacted Samsung, and just like how they handled the Note7 batteries at first, they are not taking ownership of the issue and blaming the failures on the consumers.  Even though the Samsung warranty rep I spoke with slipped and stated that they were receiving a lot of reports of cracks that customers claim were not from any impact/drops.  Still they are taking the blanket stance that any screen cracks are user caused and voids the warranty, not taking into account all the real metrics showing the glass to be fragile and it's actually manufacturer defect.  I owned a S4, S5, S6, and S7 with no issues of screen cracks.Regardless, I'm sharing my experience and warning anyone thinking about buying the phone.  FYI, my wife had the Spigen Liquid Crystal Galaxy S8 Case and Zagg Tempered Glass, I had only the Zagg Tempered glass.  The cracks actually occurred under the Zagg glass, which the Zagg glass on both phones are crack-free."
"Amazon" "What can I say. I love this phone. I works. Everything works. No glitches, responsive, beautiful screen. Every phone I have owned has had error outs setting up apps that I had on the previous phone. Not one error out on this one."
"Amazon" "Having one of the best time with this phone. Camera is really really amazing. Specially the pro mode can outdo IPhones camera in a cake walk. I am really proud of choosing this phone over IPhone 7+. It is a really safe bet."
"Amazon" "Screen quality is great. Battery life is nearly impossible to kill in a 8 hour shift with heavy use. Curved screen is unnecessary and sometimes while holding the phone to watch a video you may mess with the screen accidentally on the edges. Speaker is in a terrible spot speaking of holding the phone sideways to watch videos your finger will cover the speaker. Dropped it once and the corner shattered, really disappointing. I think the one thing that has really bothered me the most was the keyboard/word prediction. It seems to not know English very well and corrects you with odd words or is somewhat difficult to customize properly. I had to download a different keyboard that is probably equally as annoying any way. Best thing is the secure folder with fingerprint or Iris lock capabilities I believe, fingerprint for sure. Secret web browsing mode as well. Hide certain apps/images/folders you name it pretty much. Don't know if I would actually recommend. Maybe buy used or if you get a really good deal with a gift card or something."
"Amazon" "Excellent phone, works well with AT&T.This is irrelevant to the phone, but anyone that does not have a nano-SIM needs to pay $5 to AT&T to GET A SIM WITH THE SAME NUMBER"
"Amazon" "I use this phone since it's in the market- it run speed and smooth- good camera- awesome screen - a lot of choices to unlock the screen the only one down sides is- place of the finger print"
"Amazon" "Edited water having phone less than a month..Ok so I've had this phone for a week and have played on it quite a bit. I upgraded from note 3. I habe this international dual SIM version.Pros:Battery lifeScreenSizeoptionsDual SIMCamera both front and backVideo qualityFingerprint readerIris scannerConsThe screen it is very fragile even the tempered glass won't protect it.  I've had to replace it one time already and that's wad 327 dollars and today the phone slipped from 2ft of the ground and i have to replace it again.If i could go back I'd wait for the note 8 to come out the rounded edges suck."
"Amazon" "The most amazing phone I have ever owned, hands down. Also the best phone money can buy. Everything about it is amazing.Let's talk about the screen. It's taller so it fits in your hand better, and also had a higher resolution. The OLED panel on this phone is amazing and Samsung is known for it. The best in the market. Also, the almost border less design is great. No problems at all with accidental touches or anything. Works amazing.Next is the camera, best in the business really. Beautiful and highly customizable. Even has all kinds of filters and Snapchat like add ons. 12MP is still great.The battery is good as well. While battery tech is still paltry in any phone, the s8+ does surprisingly well with its massive screen. I get about a days worth (8 hours screen on time) with one charge. Pretty decent. And let's talk about the fast charge, 2nd fastest behind OnePlus only taking just under 90 minutes from 0 to 100. It's fast.As a phone, this thing can do and okay anything. Any task is doable with this phone. It has the latest Snapdragon 835 processor, for the best performance and battery life. Every game, video, or app works on this, easily.Experience is just amazing overall. Android is getting better day by day, the hardware is amazing, the software is fluid. This is by far the best phone out there. Bar none."
"Amazon" "Nothing but problems concerning the SD Card. I went to Best Buy and got assistance from a Samsung tech, I even sent it down to Texas for repair at a Samsung facility. They returned it and said they fixed it but I still had all the same issues. I'm done. For the amount of money you pay for it, it should work correctly out of the box. Returning this shortly and looking into an LG. Very, very disappointed."
"Amazon" "Most of the time when I upgrade a phone it really doesn't seem like it was worth the upgrade. This time I went from the S7 to the S8+ and wow this phone is really a step above. At first I didn't think I would like the fingerprint scanner but after using it a few days I really like the location. Easy to use one hand to unlock and resize screen if needed. Only negative thing I have to say right now is BIXBY! It is annoying."
"Amazon" "Fell from my couch cushion about 20-24\" to hardwood floor. In Otterbox commuter case, IQ Shield screen protector. Edge looks like I smashed it with a hammer and it sent a crack across the top. These phones are fragile. Read other reviews. Bixby is totally useless and annoying. Avoid!"
"Amazon" "This phone is fantastic...unless you are a Verizon customer. I have tried everything after receiving this version as a gift to get it included on the Verizon network, with no progress. It apparently is a GSM vs CDMA issue, and there is no way to configure this phone to work with the Verizon network. Now I'm hoping that it's still returnable, otherwise I'm just out of luck and still stuck with this damn iPhone I wanted to ditch."
"Amazon" "Everything works properly so far! I literally just got it in my hands about and hour ago. The only reason why I got this version was because, \"International Versions\" run Samsung's homemade chipset the \"Exynos 8895, which is definitely better than Qualcoms \"Snapdragon 835\" chipset. Another reason why this lead me into getting this version, is because I work at Best Buy Mobile and I seem to see a fare amount customers come in with problems with their S8's which are the US versions."
"Amazon" "Fabuloso!!!! Graciaaaas!!!"
"Amazon" "Purchased from my network provider not Amazon. SD Card slot doesn't work.  This is well documented, if you search google you will find it's a common complaint.  I hate bixby and the bixby button.  If you are going to include an unwanted and unneeded button that is placed so that it is frequently confused with the volume button, at least include a way to disable it or assign another function to it."
"Amazon" "the phone itself is perfectly designed, works incredibly well. the only problem is it need you to have a total amount of calling time using an American simcard before you could use the simcard from your own country. this can't be find easily from the description page for this \"international version\" \"unlocked\" phone. it will be really annoying if you don't travel to US a lot or have colleagues/friends from US."
"Amazon" "Love the phone does everything I need it. And I don't have to worry about bloatware and I  have my phone rooted as well."
"Amazon" "Good phone. Pleny of power. Does a lot. My model comes from europe but does ok. It is unlocked and so far has worked on all GSM systems i have tried it on"
"Amazon" "The hardware is awesome, the OS is awesome. but the impossible to disable Bixby is simply moronware, designed by morons for morons.  Why would anyone want a database to talk to them?  I wish I could make Bixby shut up. I suggest that Samsung terminate Bixby."
"Amazon" "Samsung just increases numbers and prices and decrease the quality .. this phone is total junk .. especially its screen .. Gorilla Glass 5 !!! scratches very easy and cracks in first drop .. so if you are buying this the first thing you are going to do is to Install Tamper Glass Screen Protector or insurance because This phone is not durable .. just put it in your pocket take it out and it is full of scratch"
"Amazon" "Bought this for my father. He needs a lot of processing speed to run his company apps and this phone has worked well for him thus far. It was between this and the pixel, but he may not notice a major difference between them. It serves all of his needs well."
"Amazon" "Love it."
"Amazon" "The screen on this Galaxy S8 + is very fragile. I had a Spigen case on it and dropped it about 2 1/2 feet and the screen cracked. Not only does the phone's screen break easily (see many of the other 2 & 1 star reviews) but it costs about $350.00 to replace.  I guess I'm going to have to go back to Apple after being a Samsung customer for the last 3 years (my Galaxy S5 Active without case was dropped at least 3 times without any damage).Samsung has lost another customer.I bought this phone on pre-sale from Best Buy so you will not see a verified purchase note on this review."
"Amazon" "excellent mobile and very good product that I acquired, so far everything perfect!!"
"Amazon" "So good. I am a traditional Samsung user, and I think the product of Samsung phone is getting better and better.Just kindly reminder, this product is international vision which means there is no warranty. But I think if you have good case and screen protector, this phone you will be using for years."
"Amazon" "I bought the S8+  from T-Mobile on Oct 7, 2017. On Oct 12, 2017 , I was downloading an app and the screen was stuck illuminated for 3 hours. The screen was illuminated for 2 hours, couldn't maneuver, had a frozen screen, and I couldn't power the device off. I had to put my phone in the bathtub because it was getting really hot. Every 15min I went to check on it and attempted to turn it off. After two hours, I was finally able to restart the phone. It works after the restart , but I'm definitely returning my device."
"Amazon" "Perfect!!!"
"Amazon" "This is an awesome phone, but the screen is very fragile. My Lifeproof case had an issue so I was forced to take the phone out. 1 small drop, cracked screen....ridiculous for a $850 phone."
"Amazon" "Meet all expectation"
"Amazon" "i love my phone. highly recommended."
"Amazon" "The Last Samsung Product I Will Ever Purchase!Prior to this terrible warrantee experience I am having I liked Samsung products. I have several in my home. However, when something goes wrong and you need to send the product in for service and repair, good luck!I purchased a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge earlier in the year after being a loyal iPhone user since the 3GS. When I made the switch I was pleasantly surprised how much I liked the phone. It worked flawlessly for about six months until a firmware update they release trashed the phone. Took it to a local Samsung rep. at Best Buy and he tried for a day and a half to replace the operating system with no luck. He said that it is still under warranty so send it in and they’ll fix it. Sounded great, however.I called their customer service number and they stared a claim, she took my information down and told me it will take around eleven days to get it back, then issued me a UPS label. I sent the phone off to them and they send me an email on June 27th confirming that they received the phone and issued me a ticket number. So far so good right?Well after the first week when by I decided to check the status of my repair through the Repair Self Tracking portal they have and was surprised to see that there was nothing in their system about my repair claim. Though to myself, that’s weird.On July 13th, after thirteen business days later of not hearing anything I called them again to check the status. They said that they were done with it but I gave them a P.O. Box address and that they can only delver to a physical address. Oh, ok I get it, a mistake. However, when the person who originally took my information shouldn’t she have told me that they required a physical address? Still, not too upset. They told me that they would ship it immediately and I would have it in 1-4 business days. Great? Not so fast.Five business days later on July 20th I still had not received my phone so I called again. The Samsung rep I talked to this time said pretty much the same thing that the last rep told me and that it has not been shipped. Now I’m irritated. I told him that they had the correct address now so what’s the problem?  He put me on hold and checked with the repair shop and a Anne told him that they would overnight it today and I would receive it tomorrow. This is where it gets really shady. I asked this person to please send me an email stating our conversation and confirming that the phone was being shipped overnight. He told me that they do not have the capability to send emails. What? Samsung can’t send emails? I was pissed off so I asked to speak to his supervisor. He put me on hold for a really long time and came back to tell me that his supervisor “Graham” will not speak with me and that he doesn’t have the capability to send an email either. Now I’m furious. I’m being lied to and this is getting really shady. I’m not sure they even have my phone at this point. He put me on hold again and talked to Anne again who told him that when they sip it later today, I would receive an email stating that it shipped. I was not happy and expressed it vividly.I then went on the web trying to find another number to contact or call someone above them all with no luck. So what I found is that if these people want to screw you over, there’s no one else to get involved or help. What a predicament.Later the same day (July 20th) I called again and talked to another representative name Angela. She checked the status and let me know that it shows on her end that my phone is scheduled to be shipped overnight and I should have tomorrow. I wasn’t holding my breath at this point.We’ll here I am now, today is July 26th and yes, still no phone. I am beyond upset and don’t know if I will ever get my phone back. I’m thinking I am going to have to get an attorney involved which will likely cost more than a new phone. I can tell you this, if this can happen to your phone, it can happen to all Samsung products. I will be switching back to an iPhone here shortly if I don’t get my phone by this Friday. I caution you to ever think about buying another product from Samsung again."
"Amazon" "I expected a larger screen, what I got is a ridiculously narrow and long screen with non standard width to height ratio. Wish I bought something else with a bigger screen."
"Amazon" "I end up getting the Galaxy 8 plus nice phone long Battery-life nice screen seems like a good phone phone does have a lot of bugs hopefully they fix it soon biggest problem is a network connection bug. voice to text maybe works 40% of the"
"Amazon" "The item was just as I expected and in the scheduled time. It worked correctly in Argentina.  I would definitely buy it again to the same seller"
"Amazon" "I'm fully satisfied with this phone! The screen is just incredible and the phone itself is not too big for me.The battery is satisfying. If I use the phone the whole day in the end of the day I have to recharge, but if you don't use the phone continuously it can last for at least two days easily."
"Amazon" "First of all, am a fun user of samsung devices. I have owned My s8+ since 1month. My problem is that when i was texting i noticed i got a spider crack on the front screen which made me shocked and mad at the same time. I haven't face this issue before. I have owned a note 3 before it lasted for 3 years with me without any issue. S8+ is a powerful smartphone i have ever seen except the screen. It is very senestive and too much expensive for replacement :("
"Amazon" "Great phone"
"Amazon" "Love the phone. Chose this over the Snapdragon version because I always get comments about bootloader being locked with the US version so I went with the international and I'm loving it. Samsung is great at complimenting the Android OS with other features. Lesser bloat would make this phone phenomenal."
"Amazon" "the best"
"Amazon" "Since I purchased this phone and receive it has Perform perfectly and perform as expected I love it"
"Amazon" "Just received it and the home button does not work. The pressure sensitive button works maybe 1 out of 10 times. It's also a different model than what Amazon says it is. Amazon says its the G955F, but I received the G955FD which is the DUOS model. I've started the refund progress. I'll update when I know more."
"Amazon" "I hate Bixby. Samsung please disable Bixby. The phone is a piece of glass. Buy the case before you buy the phone. Otherwise it's a great phone."
"Amazon" "Love this phone. Fast, great battery, awesome screen and no bloatware"
"Amazon" "Great pruduct. Ir works beautifully and super fast. The delivery: days before programmed.I just love my new phone..."
"Amazon" "This phone does not work for Verizon. It’s also made in UAE so it will not be covered by Samsung manufactur warranty."
"Amazon" "I bought mine through Verison. It is $35 a month with their unlimited plan. I added a 200GB Samsung brand SD card, and I put a Clayco protective case on the phone.So far, the battery is great. It will last days on power saver mode, and several hours in high performance mode.It plays Super Smash Bros Melee with the Dolphin Emulator with relative ease.I use a Blue Tooth game controller for that, and it's great!"
"Amazon" "Phone was good for a while then seemed defective. Samsung update made phone mess up still in good condition. I would like a refund or exchange for a new device"
"Amazon" "Not complains.. Best phone ever"
"Amazon" "Nothing but trouble!!  Apps would not turn off draining the battery. I love all the Samsuns I have had but NOT THIS ONE!"
"Amazon" "Bought my S8+ direct from Samsung. It's the best phone I've ever owned."
"Amazon" "I bought it to be sent abroad through a relative who was visiting. Phone charged but was losing battery charge in less than one day with NO activity whatsoever!!!! Adjusted some setting, such as turning off the clock when not in use and brightness, but it did not help much. It was still losing power and needed to be recharged at the end of the day without being used at all. I did not have time to send back and request a new one (or maybe just a refund). I am not sure who to blame, but if I could, I would have returned the item and gone to a local store after the experience. A new item should not be functioning like that. I have talked to people who owns the same phone and they said it was strange it was losing power that fast!"
"Amazon" "This is an excellent phone.  The best I ever had. It is fast."
"Amazon" "Hi. I would like to promote this Galaxy s8 plus phone on my Youtube channel, and i would like a free working sample of this phone. Thanks."
"Amazon" "After a few months I still like this phone. However, I do not like the curved edge! Fantastic idea but not a practical application. After being told by Verizon employees that it did not have \"gorilla glass\",  I purchased their recommended tempered glass protector. After it popped off several times within the next few days I exchanged it for a different one. This one stayed on about two weeks. With no other viable option I was left with just trying to catch it when it repeatedly popped off. Eventually, of course, the 50$ glass was just gone. I do have the phone in an \"Otter Box\" case. I have accepted that I have signed a two year contract on a phone that is extremely fragile and this does not make me happy at all!"
"Amazon" "Wonderful phone. Best camera I've seen so far and very customizable. There's just so much you can do. I never get tired of it."
"Amazon" "I'm loving this phone. I like the fact it has space for two sim cards."
"Amazon" "this was a gift to someone"
"Amazon" "I am using this Glaxey 8 plus in Italy and I'm very happy and satisfied"
"Amazon" "I highly recommmend"
"Amazon" "If you like Samsung JUST BUY IT! don't even think about it. I wasn't sure about buying this mobile Phone, but now after 3 weeks having it in my hands its just the best cellphone ever!"
"Amazon" "Outdated firmware (7.0) lots of bloatware on device. Very bad update policies."
"Amazon" "Excellent product, the best cell phone!!!"
"Amazon" "Worst phone i have ever owned. Either the battery went bad or the charging circuit/battery calibration failed right after the warranty expired. Terrible customer service and they would not stand behind their product. Over-priced junk! Remember, these phones are only as good as their battery and ALL batteries fail after a certain amount of charge cycles. Again, over-priced junk!"
"Amazon" "Great phone. Just as advertised!"
"Amazon" "It was a nice product ! Very fast shipping as well !"
"Amazon" "This is one of your best phone by far, this phone beats out the Galaxy S5. I enjoy the screen, design, and the iris scanner. The camera takes the best pictures."
"Amazon" "Excellent piece! Struggling to sleep without it in my hand!"
"Amazon" "The phone came used and broken!"
"Amazon" "Very Good"
"Amazon" "I received the phone on time it works perfectly and is exactly as described. This is the best smartphone i have ever had!"
"Amazon" "THE BEST"
"Amazon" "Good experience !!"
"Amazon" "Awesome phone.  Especially the camera!"
"Amazon" "Hello, I would like promete this phone on my instagram page because i do make up . I would love to promote it because it has an awesome camera and great graphics"
"Amazon" "In love with this phone. After Apple for the last 8 years it's a revelation. It has dual sim (ordered from Amazon.com)."
"Amazon" "I love this phone. Although it is fragile and expensive, but it is worth the price, design and style. I would recommend this to anyone."
"Amazon" "Screen broke after a few months of use. First time I've ever had that happen on a \"flagship\" device. Back to the aging Nexus 6P I guess.Oh and when I called Samsung about it they wanted $300 to replace it.Then when I said it was the international version they said they couldn't help me. I had to call the Samsung office in the country it came from. I don't get why that matters. It's going to be a call center run by a bunch of hard to understand Indian morons anyways.Thankfully Amazon gave me a refund."
"Amazon" "I have not even used the phone.  It was taken out the box to install.  It was dropped on the floor during the process.  It is shattered on all corners and cracks all the way across the front and back of the phone."
"Amazon" "Phone ended up having a defect, but Amazon was great and sent me a replacement."
"Amazon" "Had several issues with connecting to the network. Before I used to have 5 bars using my old phone and now I have one or no connection at all. It does not work with the Samsung pay either."
"Amazon" "I got this phone through Verizon and for the most part it's not bad but the bixby BS is so annoying. I'm constantly pushing the button pulling it out of my pocket and launching an app that I have no use for."
"Amazon" "The only thing I dislike so much id the keyboard which has no precision at all."
"Amazon" "I love to getting on YouTube and I would love to have this product"
"Amazon" "...DO NOT GET THIS PHONE UNTIL SAMSUNG FIXES THE RESTART PROBLEM...On my 2nd S8+ which has the same restart problem as the first one.  I am locked out of my phone now. ill go back to Sprint see what they want to do next.  SAMSUNG cannot afford to have this kind of problem after the Note 7 mess. still no word from Samsung about this problem. there are hundreds of people with this problem. I spend 4+ hours in there developer blog stuff and no one has a fix for this. it restarts with SD card in or out, have done hard boot. took out all apps I could. nothing works. been to Samsung's web site tried almost everything there nothing works. About every 30 minutes phone will restart...Update phone problem seems to have gone away. It took a lot of hours to do. Not sure what was cause but not AS card. Sprint store in Chubbuck, Idaho did everything and some but phone works great now..Low this phone but I will be getting Note 8 when it comes out. This thinner phone which has 18 by 9 screen size fits your hand great. Not thrilled with the finger print placement but I don't use it. Beautiful screen, fast charge 47 minutes from 4% to 99%. Extremely fast prossesor.  Games work perfect. Not real happy with the 1 speaker at bottom of phone, but it is loud enough. Need speakers like Motorola X series. Stereo front facing. Overall now happy with my phone. Will update next month. 6/21/17..will give 4.5 stars because USB C on this phone does not work with USB C headphones."
"Amazon" "Awesome phone with dual Sim card."
"Amazon" "A fabulous phone. Complaints that you see on line are from naysayers, the probably hate their lives too"
"Amazon" "Is it works in india network and is it international warranty for this phone"
"Amazon" "Amazing phone!"
"Amazon" "I bought this for my friend and she loves it. Since this is unlocked phone she uses this when she goes to a foreign land. Text were clear and could easily be read even at a low lighting. Highly recommend, even this kind of phone is a little bit pricy."
"Amazon" "Excellent Product and seller 100% recommended"
"Amazon" "Wouldn't charge, comparability issues."
"Amazon" "Beautiful phone"
"Amazon" "Awsome"
"Amazon" "Forced Bixby app always pops up and is hardwired to button.  UnAmerican, unethical, and uncivilized to force consumer decisions and behaviors.  Removal apps by third parties force disabling security features so that is not an option.  My only real decision I still have is to return it for a non-Samsung device.  No more Samsung."
"Amazon" "I love the phone, but why was an British charger unit  with a 3 prong (rectangular 3rd prong) sent instead of a standard  charger. I purchased the international unlocked phone in the US for my US use and my extensive travels to Asia"
"Amazon" "I bought a S8 plus phone in your store through the personal shoper of myus, when I reached my hands, I restarted the phone and it does not recognize my sim card, says it has just Verizon's, please help me this is the my email luismorais12@hotmail.com"
"Amazon" "Love this toy.Works perfectly, is international unlocked, I was using in different continents and no issues."
"Amazon" "Paying almost 900 dollars for a phone and then some for a case you'd think it wouldn't break. My screen has shattered twice now. I've never broken a phone before in my life. I've never dropped this phone either. One minute it's fine and the next it's shattered. It was in my purse all day next to my cloth wallet. I never set my purse down nor did it get hit/leaned on/thrown/etc.. I pull out the phone and it's shattered. I'm so frustrated and angry that something this expensive would break for no apparent reason. TWICE. If I could give 0 stars, I would. This is absurd. I want my money back."
"Amazon" "Great Amazon customer service and great phone love it had a problem with it Amazon solved it right away now I'm very satisfied with what I have especially the s8plus screen"
"Amazon" "This product says unlocked for international and i bought it and sent to africa(Nigeria) and it didn't work so disappointed"
"Amazon" "works well"
"Amazon" "excellent product and great services"
"Amazon" "Hey im a big youtuber and would love to promote and review your product.I currently have s8 an would like to try the plus for my fans."
"Amazon" "So nice"
"Amazon" "its amazing this phone"
"Amazon" "Hated the placement of fingerprint scanner and bloatware. Replaced it with a OnePlus 5T."
"Amazon" "Nice cell, I expected the camera to be even better, but it satisfies me."
"Amazon" "very good"
"Amazon" "Hey!! I'm big on YouTube, if you send me a phone I will promote it."
"Amazon" "Bad phone. Lagwiz is still slow and unresponsive. Exynos = No stable aosp roms"
"Amazon" "As advertised. Brand new. Fast shipping."
"Amazon" "Simply Awesome !"
"Amazon" "100%"
"Amazon" "I bought this product, but I can't say anything about the quality, unfortunately the box was empty"
"Amazon" "Great Product!"
"Amazon" "decepción ..."
"Amazon" "Works great. Came sealed."
"Amazon" "Great phone!!! Works well"
"Amazon" "I am very satisfied with the new S8 cellphone and the ease in using same."
"Amazon" "Before you buy this phone, read reviews on the durability of the screen. There is no question whether or not you will break your screen. It WILL break. My screen broke after 2 weeks with both a screen protector and case on the phone. The S8 has the most fragile screen of any smartphone EVER. Don't believe me? Google it. Do not purchase this phone. Samsung tried to make up for their last failure and just made something equally terrible. There is no way that this screen is made of Gorilla Glass. My LG screen never broke, and I dropped it off of a 10 foot ladder onto concrete. Samsung is a joke. Stay away."
"Amazon" "Excelent"
"Amazon" "Great"
"Amazon" "Very nice product......"
"Amazon" "The phone worked, looks good, but the charge is European!!!! I can't charge the phone with that!!!!"
"Amazon" "I read the reviews on this phone it was supposed to be compatible with Sprint services could not connect through Sprint they said I had to go to AT&T can't believe that  Sprint was trying to drive me away from them had to return the phone because they could not put in a SIM card . I was very disappointed I was looking forward to having a new phone."
"Amazon" "Well, this is the very last Samsung phone I will ever own. I had 3 Note 5's previously all with their own sets of issues, and several different Samsung phones before that. The S8 lags horribly. When visiting web pages it will randomly bounce to the top/middle of the page for about 3 seconds before it settles down and starts working properly. The screen is very unresponsive, I have to hit the same area anywhere from 2-4 times to get it to register. Apps crash randomly. TouchWiz is still awful. There's more but I'm running a blank, this is just what I've noticed after 24 hours. The entire phone just feels unrefined and terrible. Never again."
"Amazon" "Everybody has hyped this phone to the moon, and I was super excited to get it. I've literally been counting down the days since the release date was announced. I am so frustrated with this inconsistent piece of crap. This thing cost me too much money to be so upset about the functionality or, lack thereof... The spilt screen feature is terrible. It was much better on the s6, and the s6 was a disaster. The keyboard is awful, apps crash constantly, the back button will sometimes take you back one page, and sometimes will land you on the home screen. The sound quality is abysmal. The volume with headphones is about half what it needs to be. The battery lasts about eight hours, with normal use, in entertainment mode (which is opening a whole new can of worms, as entertainment mode should be standard. The biggest selling point of the phone is the incredible display, and you're telling me that it isn't wise to use it to it's fullest potential?) A giant failure on the part of Samsung. I believe the hyped reviews have been bought and paid for by Samsung, who has been in damage control for two years, and really needed this phone to be successful. I'm done with Samsung. I will never buy another Samsung product again, not in some effort to hurt samsung, but to keep their substandard crap out of my home. This is two stinkers in a row for me, and they won't fool me again."
"Amazon" "Phone won't recognize on my computer at all. I tried plugging it into other computers, but it still wouldn't show up. Very frustrating!The Edge screen is unbelievably annoying as well. No good tempered glass screen protectors for this phone exist. I don't know why SAMSUNG thought it would be a good idea to force the curved screen onto all of its customers without designing a protection solution that actually works."
"Amazon" "Could be better."
"Amazon" "Have run the gamut to reach a point of solution toward a Sim Unlock Solution through BOTH Parties, Samsung & T-Mo, both in denial. This is a Samsung.com purchase out right, with T-Mo as carrier. TMo claims IMEI is a Non-TMo device, although it has TMo Jingle w/pink boot, etc. And Unusable TMo Unlock App...TMo not touching it....!!Samsung says absolutely NOT True. I conferenced both parties. They conversed, TMo Senior Rep says.  \"It comes Unlocked...!\", No worries. Complete B.S....liars.Anyway, return or persevere.... ?Haven't decided, cause I am happy too be back to Android, from Crapple....but need an Intl Access device. Any one else out there had any Luck with A Sim Unlock... Please respond.  !!! Aaaah...!! 😅😅🤡Both parties are completely out of touch with this Product ..."
"Amazon" "Need  Device ID (ESN/ IMEI / MEID) - Samsung Galaxy S8 / S8+  Don't have  Can't Use without"
"Amazon" "Battery issues again"
"Amazon" "BUYER BEWARE! WORST PHONE EVER!!"
"Amazon" "Mine was an Italian version and Samsung pay doesn't work on it (disappointing), bixby wouldn't work the first 2 months I had it, and many of the samsung apps are in Italian and can't be changed. Other than that, it's great."
"Amazon" "Beautiful, excellent phone"
"Amazon" "Perfect"
"Amazon" "It totally worth it!"
"Amazon" "Cellphone is perfect. Arrived on time. Everything ok"
"Amazon" "Lasted one day and the screen turned into green. Cannot return it now because Im from abroad. Feels like I got ripped off.[[ASIN:B06Y1652H5 Samsung Galaxy S8 64GB Unlocked Phone - International Version (Arctic Silver)."
"Amazon" "The screen has cracked for the 2nd time during the last 3 months. And repairs start at 250. The rest of the characteristics don't matter so much when the whole screen becomes a spider web every several weeks. This phone will cost you 2-3 times more during ownership."
"Amazon" "Awesome great phone! Came new. Came about 4 days early. I live in Okinawa Japan and it does not work with AU but works with Softbank.My complaints about the phone is the speaker ( only using the bottom facing speaker.) And the Bluetooth 5.0 . I think its worse than the older types of Bluetooth but split audio is really nice.Pictures and videos are alot nicer than the Iphone 7 plus and it has a audio port for all your wired devices.No regrets buying this phone."
"Amazon" "I am really happy with the S8! I had an Amazon Fire phone that I really liked for its simplicity and dependability. However, it was time I moved up to more features. This is a great phone with programming and features that should keep me occupied for quite a while.  It actually has programs I can use. It's simple to operate, good battery time. Fast and reliable."
"Amazon" "I couldn't use it as Verizon told me they couldn't unlock it so I had to send it back!"
"Amazon" "the selfie camera hardly ever worked, it would never stay in focus for more than a second so it would take forever to get a good looking picture, and it was not as water resistant as they say it is, i want to the beach and the phone was under water \" less than 2 feet\" for less than a minute and but the time it was out if the water it wouldn't turn on"
"Amazon" "My boyfriend recently purchased this phone. The sound quality is amazing! Before when talking on the phone I could never hear him and it made every word difficult to understand. Now with him having this delightful device I can hear everything! Never more excited to listen to the splash as his turd falls in the toilet!"
"Amazon" "Works great!"
"Amazon" "So satisfied! Quick shipment and good communication from seller. Thanks :)"
"Amazon" "I love my new phone, no problems with it being International. This is my second international phone since I travel for my job,it's much easier to have phone that I can just pop a SIM card in and go."
"Amazon" "This was a gift and the party is very happy with it. Thank you so much."
"Amazon" "Justo note some things will come in Italian... be ready to change them to English and you should be all set. Great phone!"
"Amazon" "Great phone and an excelllent upgrade from the S6 I had before.  I unfortunately cracked the screen the day I bought it from an 8\" drop.  I purchased a case and screen protector rhe same day.  I can't complain it's the nicest phone i've ever personally owned.  I just am waiting for some innovated person to design a case & glass protector that does not interfere with the functionality of the phone and conforms to the curved glass.  I did need to mention that the seller refused to even acknowledge my desire to return thebunopened item when I recieved it.  I am happy I still own the telephone so all is good."
"Amazon" "Phone having errors and freezing even after carrier reflashed the stock software on the phone. Samsung and my carrier keep cold transferring my to the other and promising call back. Two days and 6 hours of phone calls later still no solution or help at all from samsung."
"Amazon" "it looks good and I got what  I expected to get. also I got it in certain time. thanks"
"Amazon" "Poor battery life, hard to charge...Anyone else that has one of these phones notice that if you try to charge it just using a USB cable to you computer, it barely charges?And the Samsung wireless charging dock I bought with it is not reliable...it shuts off some nights  and I find phone charged only 75% after being on wireless charger all night.BTW:  There are some days when the battery life starts at 100% but is down to 65% by 10am, after only a little use.This is a deal killer for me...I already paid $900+ and now I have to buy more $35 Samsung chargers.  That's ridiculous.  And all the other inconveniences (button in wrong spot, adware preloaded, etc) make me wish I had stayed with iPhone."
"Amazon" "Beautiful phone! Was hesitant to buy because I wasn't too sure about what the international model phone was. On AT&T it was a breeze to activate. Simply took the sim card from my Galaxy s6 into the Galaxy s8 and I was good to go! Love my new phone."
"Amazon" "It is awesome do far and is dual chip in contrary of some comments i saw before i received it."
"Amazon" "has problems with the screen"
"Amazon" "I like because it is simple, I don't like when I have to write, pictures, videos specially what up, the I phone is more complicated but better on that issue."
"Amazon" "So far this phone just amazingThank you"
"Amazon" "Best cellphone ever! came well packed, and the cellphone is amazing!"
"Amazon" "\"Bixby\" will be the death of Samsun"
"Amazon" "Don't get this phone, if you break the glass in cannot be repaired anywhere!"
"Amazon" "Awsome phone"
"Amazon" "I couldn't be happier with the purchase of this phone!! So far, I'm not seeing any drawbacks."
"Amazon" "Great"
"Amazon" "I thought I requested a dual sum version but it turns out mine is not. Was a bit disappoint but the device itself is breath takingly beautiful. Nothing wrong so far whatsoever"
"Amazon" "Totally recommended"
"Amazon" "its a good phone but my simcard doesnt work. I live in Japan, i am a bit dissapointed. anyone know how to fix this?its even an international simcard for foreigners visiting japan..."
"Amazon" "Amazing phone. Can't ask for more.  Good job by Samsung.  Excellent build quality."
"Amazon" "Thank you!"
"Amazon" "Simply Awesome !!!!!!!!!!"
"Amazon" "Great"
"Amazon" "It's OK, problems with the touchscreen when you put the tempered glass cover...."
"Amazon" "Beautiful device but came with Italian voda phone applications that cant be removed"
"Amazon" "I just received my phone today! it looks and works great. Hope is gonna be like that. Thank you!"
"Amazon" "Got it perfectly"
"Amazon" "Its everkthing ok"
"Amazon" "took this phone first to Verizon to activate they told me it was GSM so could not activate as they are CDMA compatible only.  Took it to AT&T who told me it was incompatible with their service too.  It's going back.  Wasted my entire day on junk!"
"Amazon" "Crappy device. I bought it less than a month ago and the camera already stopped working. The thing is I bought the cell phone specifically with the purpose of photographing the birth of my first child. I am admitted to the maternity ward, delivery will be on Friday, but I will not be able to use the device, which was sent to technical assistance. I've been an Iphone user for many years and I've just migrated to Samsung. I could not be more disappointed. My advice is: stick with Apple products."
"Amazon" "muy buen producto."
"Amazon" "That's not real international un lock phone"
"Amazon" "This Unit can't be activated at USA.  Per Springs Phone company."
"Amazon" "No, it was returned due to not being compatible with phone service."
"Amazon" "Almost everything about the phone and its spec seem great and innovative.  But I can't believe the silly idea of a curve screen is still in.  It's really a nuisance that chunks of your screen (along with your contents) are rolled off on both edges.  I still find it to be a huge distraction because the rounded edges cause reflections along those curved edges.  Also, I keep finding myself rotating the phone just to see contents at the edges. The contents on your screen shouldn't be subjected to such distortions by design. So the whole idea is really, really goofy. It might have looked cool to some 2 years ago when it first came out, but common Samsung?  Three stars off because the screen is so much of what you use the most, despite the overall spec.I still plan on buying a future Samsung phones for a family member if a flat screen version is available, but the curved edges is really holding me back.  Samsung, please consider releasing a flat screened version.Update: another star off for the location of the finger print sensor.  I am still causing the camera lens to smudge because the sensor is damn right next to it."
"Amazon" "Let this be said about the Samsung Galaxy S8 + \"AT&T Unlocked\". This doesn't mean anything except you can make calls using your AT&T sim card. This phone doesn't connect to the 4G network, so if you want to use your data outside of whatever wifi network you're connected to, forget it. It gives you the option to turn on your mobile network, but when you try to adjust the settings everything is grayed out, so you can't change it.Disappointing to say the least. I can't believe I spent this much money on something I can only use where there is wifi available. I might has well have bought an old-school flip phone."
"Amazon" "I bought this from another seller on release day - This is another great phone from Samsung.  This is my 4th phone (I even had the Galaxy Note 7 for 2 weeks)  and this is a great device.Pros*Infinity screen - nice for watching videos, as they will stretch to fit.  Nice HD image!*Battery Life - Good, will last me ~2 days (my note 4 lasted only 1)*Sound - Internal speaker is much better than other generations and included ANK headphones are a nice bonus*Fast - Have over 100 apps on my phone and all are quick*Memory - Has 64GB memory which is nice vs the 32gb standard*Easy transfer - I was able to easily transfer everything from my old phone with no issues*Camera - Nice and crisp.  Decent low light images as well*USB-C - Samsung has done well at this, including 2 adapters (USB-C to USB and Micro-usb to USB-c)*Bixby - It will be nice to have a nice SIRI alternativeCons*Internal speaker is on bottom of phone, and I seem to accidentally cover it a lot*Infinity display gets touched often, because it is all the way to the edges*No home, back, or task button - these are now softkeys, which i don't like as well*Bixby not fully functional on release date - they could have given old s-voice as an alternative until Bixby is finishedOverall, I would recommend this phone"
"Amazon" "quick service! good phone. Had description as mint condition, came with flaw on the back around the camera (4 stars), however function and productivity of the phone is perfection. would highly recommend and order from them again."
"Amazon" "Godd for the price ipay"
"Amazon" "Amazon is amazing! Great deal for a practially brand new galaxy s8 plus! =]"
"Amazon" "Great!!!"
"Amazon" "I did not like this phone.  I returned this within 14.  I was charged a restocking fee."
"Amazon" "DO NOT BUY IT !!!!!!!Um I can only text for some reason with this phone and I have at&t and nobody is returning my emails or anything so maybe this will get their attentiom DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!"
"Amazon" "Buenos hasta la ahorita."
"Amazon" "Fonts is a lot small than my 5 and it works a lot like an I phone ,and I am not a fan of iPhone"
"Amazon" "Good product and Excellent service."
"Amazon" "Dual sim capability is great! It pushes 4G/3G as I hoped."
"Amazon" "Fast delivery and came with adapter. Good service. Loving my new phone."
"Amazon" "No issues to talk about . Thank you !"
"Amazon" "Very happy with my new phone."
"Amazon" "Great, I love it!!!"
"Amazon" "Perfect, exactly as expected."
"Amazon" "Love it"
"Amazon" "Excellent device. Really quick."
"Amazon" "For those of you that are consider buying this phone, let me mention some common variation of this phone:SM-G955F: International version, Samsung Exynos Processor (supposedly use less battery, last longer) , for GSM carriersSM-G955FD: International version, Duel Sim Card, Samsung Exynos Processor (supposedly use less battery, last longer) , for GSM carriersSM-G955U: US version, Snap Dragon Processor (supposedly better graphic support for gaming), I see people said the unlocked version support both GSM and CDMA carriers, but I do not have this version and have not verify this myself.Above are for S8+, S* is similar, part number replaced 955 with 950, with smaller screen and battery power.I used SM-G955FD:for about a month now, this is the most expensive phone I purchased.  Below is my list of pro and con.Pro:Decent Camera, good with low light environment.Great Battery life, 3500 amh, last longer then any other phone I had in the past.Support wireless charging, water-proof.Less overheating.  It gets warm when playing games while charging but never gets to point where it is too hot to hold.Con:Unusual Screen ratio.  Most game app do 16:9 screen ratio, this phone is thinner so when playing games, there are black boarder on both side and make it look smaller compare to other phone with same screen size in the market.  This also make it more difficult to type, I often press wrong key by accident due to spacing.Overall, I think this is a good phone.  Best Buy is offering a lot of promotion on this phone right now so you might wish to shop around before choosing where to buy it."
"Amazon" "Beware of these that say No Warranty. Mine arrived with the plastic all wrinkled and missing the headphones. Normally I would care about not having headphones as I never use them but the screen was not responsive at all. I returned it."
"Amazon" "A very solid 4.5 Stars This is just my review of the S8 Plus. I got mine through AT&T as my upgrade. I was trying to wait for the Note 8 but my Note 4 bricked when the power died during an update so I had to replace it with something fast.The S8 Plus is a really nice-looking phone and the camera is awesome. It's probably the best feature so far (I've had mine for about 3 weeks). I don't like that I can't replace the battery if I ever wanted to.The Bixby feature is somewhat useful but there is a bit of a learning curve to using it. I haven't been using it much but that's because I'm busy getting used to the rest of the phone.One thing that I really *don't* like about the phone is that it is slippery as an eel. I almost dropped it the first time I held it because it's so slick. The phone is very thing (a good thing, I guess), but I keep it in a protective case. One reason I immediately got a case for it was just to be able to hold and handle it better. Whenever it's out of the case, I'm scared to death do use it because I know I'll drop it.If this phone has the built-in stylus like the Note series, I would like it better than the Note 3 and 4 which I've had. The display is crystal crisp and beautiful. I got mine in the Arctic Silver and wish that I could actually see it, but I have to keep that casing on it! I know that some people wanted the smoother outer design, but I'd much rather that it were pebbled - or at least along the edges. I bet half the time the phone gets damaged will not be from carelessness but from the phone just sliding out of people's hands.So, to sum up, the PROs:- Phone is gorgeously styled and the color choices are nice. I really like the Arctic Silver which is stylish and still professional/adult looking.- Camera is *amazing*. Photos turn out awesome and the easy-flip to selfie feature is nice.- Volume control is better. You can more easily control volume for all settings (Media, Headset, Notifications, etc) than before.- Fingerprint placing isn't as bad as I expected and is a lot more responsive than on past Galaxy phones.- There are temperature sensors so I can use the apps that I couldn't with the Note 4.- Wireless Qcoil charging is possible. (With the Note 4 I had to buy a Qi  receiver to place inside the phone to work with a charger.)- Sound quality - for calls and media - is especially good. This was a surprise to me.CONS:- While the body design is beautiful, the phone is slippery and very easily dropped. It's a MUST to have a case on it to make it easier to hold.- Bixby needs to be a bit more user-friendly since it's so new to most of us.- The charging ports have changed so all the cords I had for past Galaxy phones are now worthless. Also, the new USB C type chargers don't work with my Samsung tablet. It's a little like changing the game to make customers shell out more money for accessories.- There is no built-in stylus. This is such a wonderful feature - and probably the only real standout feature - on the Notes, I'm surprised Samsung hasn't integrated it into their other models.OVERALL:If I could change 2 things, it would be the slippery-ness and that there is no built-in stylus. As a firm Note 4 fanatic, I am not that unhappy to have this phone instead."
"Amazon" "This is a beast of a phone. Its design and screen are just fantastic.Easy to handle and very sleek. Awesome camera. Nice UI. Fully featured.It is slightly slippery though. Make sure to put a cover on it.As mentioned, it is an international model from UAE. Genuine product. I bought from Wireless Place seller and using it in India.Would not go more into pros and cons as you can find them online. Just look at them pics and decide for yourself.Please rate this review as helpful if you find it to be.Thanks,Jatin"
"Amazon" "This is a really good phone with amazing display. I received the shipment in very good shape (and all the items which are supposed to be there are included). It was very kind of the seller to also provide an converter for the adapter. It has been only 24 hours since I'm using the phone, but still here are my feedback with the limited use:Pros:- Display is simply amazing. This is the best display I've seen in a smart phone till date.- Battery life is decent, given that it's my first day so I'm using it quite a lot, but still able to get decent enough battery life at the end of the day.- Both the facial and iris recognition works very fast, I don't know how secure they are, but for me it works fine if there is some level of security and it opens real quick.- Included earphones are decent enough (not too great).- Always on display mode is really helpful.Cons:- The good old finger print whine. How can designers be so foolish to place it at the worst possible location on the phone. Seems like they were too proud to simply copy the ideal placement from Nexus/Pixel line. I might get used to it, but right now it's a conscious effort each and every-time.- The phone is too slippery in the hand, so it'll be almost impossible to carry it without a  protective case.- Again what were they thinking when they launched Bixby. It's almost pathetic in comparison to Google Assistant. I might end up remapping the Bixby button to GA anyways.- Not a flaw of the mobile, but this particular international version doesn't have a warranty (as is rightly mentioned in the product description), so you can't register the phone on Samsung US website."
"Amazon" "I received a demo phone empty and a different model. These are crooks. It's a fraud."
"Amazon" "I literally got my phone the day after it was ordered. The product was as described. The battery and storage on this phone is amazing! Before this phone, I had the s5 that couldn't even hold up 5 hours total. This phone gets me through the day and plus some. I was also able to transfer everything from my s5 to this phone with just a few taps of a button during the startup. My carrier is cricket.Fyi, if you are transferring SIM cards from your old phone to your new phone, make sure that the SIM card is a nano one.  I had the average sized one in my s5 and needed to go to my provider to exchange SIMs"
"Amazon" "I was in the USA, I received the device and when I arrived here in Brazil, I put my Chip and when I turned the device on it has white and black spots on the screen, I think the problem is the screen, because I have another device and this does not happen ."
"Amazon" "Best phone ever.Dual sim, and brand new even in America. I'm using in Brazil, and is working perfect.Way Better Then The S7 and much better The The Iphone 7.I do recomend it"
"Amazon" "Great phone that has all the features you're looking for in a flagship, but also with Dual-Sim.  Just FYI, here in the US ATT doesn't support dual-sim (rolling my eyes) so you can't have them work at the same time.  For the record my personal is T-Mobile, work is ATT.  Dual-SIm is active, however, it's via call forwarding because of ATT's lack of support.  The phone comes unlocked which is great if you root your phone.  Overall, I'm happy with the phone, as I am moving from Nexus devices to Sammy."
"Amazon" "What a mistake I made.  It said it might be international stock (and it is---for the UK) but I was not smart enough to know how much difference that made.  I cannot register it and most importantly I cannot get any updates for so\"smart switch\" smartly I could find a work around for this.  However I have been told by a Samsung rep to my face that it is likely that I will always have problems with this phone and quite possible that I do not have enough technical expertise to get the first major software update via smartswitch.  I spent the return window trying to get things to work correctly and did not get to a Samsung rep in person.  All of this is my fault.  I have made an expensive mistake and do not know what my options are.  I have been too trusting of Amazon.  I know they don't really screen the products they list but I used to trust them more than say  EBay.  My advice is don't trust anyone."
"Amazon" "Great phone, and good supplier. No problem working on US network (att). The model itself: don't like the curved screen edge (if you lay your phone flat the light from alerts can still wake you (or your wife) up). Also, really don't like Bixby (but I like my privacy and don't like listening devices on my phone and think people who buy Alexa or Google home are nuts, so there's that.)"
"Amazon" "It has a great infinity screen. I love it so much. A lot of extra space to do on your phone. The 2 things are not so great about this phone: 1) it has a weird location for the fingerprint scanner and 2) the battery does not able to hold the whole day if your a very active user."
"Amazon" "I only had this phone for 1 week; then i started seeing white vertical lines, then it blanked out(obviously it was defective), called samsung and they were of no help, they told me i had to buy a screen replacement which was half the price of the phone. i felt very disappointed, sent it back to amazon and thank God, got a refund. Because of the customer service i received from samsung am switching to apple and buying an iphone. i have aways been a samsung user but after that experience i am making the switch."
"Amazon" "I was a bit worried my phone wouldn't work or something wrong could have happened, but NO! After buying this product I changed my mind and I am LOVING my new phone. Recommend to buy this product if looking for a S8+!!!! :D"
"Amazon" "This is an amazing phone Samsung has really outdone themselves it is very sleek and operates very fast I could not be happier. A nice protective case is a must with this phone it is very slippery. And I wish that Samsung will provide a better charger these are kind of cheap. Overall very happy with the product"
"Amazon" "Galaxy s8 plus:I finally got my dream phone... i came with new akg ear buds Fast charger and usb type c adapters it also came with the instructions new box including the phone it came in today really fast service if you have any questions please feel free to DM me on Instagram @j053jose"
"Amazon" "phone works great as expected. fully compatible with my phone company in the Caribbean. Picture quality is the best I've seen thus far. My only complaint is that the phone I received was no rose old as I had ordered but silver/rey."
"Amazon" "Great!"
"Amazon" "Spec wise.. this is a nice phone.. got one BOGO from t-mobile BUT BE SURE 100% TO GET A CASE AND A SCREEN PROTECTOR FOR ITThis is the most fragile screen I've literally ever seen on a phone.  I scratched it the second day just by having it in my pocket with my keys.  My fiances phone screen actually broke JUST BEING IN HER PURSE.  There is a lot of complaints online if you look for them of it falling 3 ft onto carpet and shattering the screen"
"Amazon" "Love this phone. It came well packaged and was very easy to set up. I use two sim cards and it beats carrying two phones."
"Amazon" "This phone is wonderful i love it.It is new and lovely"
"Amazon" "Great smartphone!!! I love it.  Excellent service by the seller.  The only thing I could regret is that Samsung took off the IR blaster which I used a lot in my house instead of all my remote controls."
"Amazon" "Worse phone design ever!  The curved infinity screen interferes with most cases that you need to buy to protect its fragile design.  Cracked mine (with a 3 dimensional case on it) with 2 months.  I only dropped it from 3 feet.  It cracked in the bottom edge due to the impact of the fall.  Case was not broken!  It's due to the fragile infinity screen I'm convinced of that."
"Amazon" "If you're considering a Samsung S8+ just know, my phone has terrible burn-in on the AMOLED screen. Just went a week without the phone while it went back to Samsung for repair. I got it back and there's dirt behind the screen. They now want the phone back again. Terrible customer service."
"Amazon" "It works great in Honduras"
"Amazon" "Great phone. Love the dual sim feature!!!"
"Amazon" "Oh yeah"
"Amazon" "I hate Bixby. Samsung please disable Bixby. The phone is a piece of glass. Buy the case before you buy the phone. Otherwise it's a great phone."
"Amazon" "AWESOME phone!!!"
"Amazon" "My wife had issue with her note 4 and decided to surprise her with s8 plus on her birthday. She really love the phone especially for the picture quality and clear selfie she can take with the phone. It's worth every bit of the price"
"Amazon" "I LOVE THIS PHONE THE BEST PHONE EVER"
"Amazon" "It is a model made for UAE - an Arabic country. The battery life is shorter compare the same phone made for US."
"Amazon" "Everything works amazing! Although I must admit it is a huge disappointment the fact that you either can have two sims or one sim and one micro SD but not all at the same time, for the rest it is amazing!"
"Amazon" "The best that I have had."
"Amazon" "I love it"
"Amazon" "Excellent item! Great seller!!"
"Amazon" "Great phone, was not compatible with Verizon network. They said some unlocked international work, some don't,  it depended on the SIM EISN # . Not having access to the specific number who can check? My last unlocked international Samsung the S6 Edge+ worked just fine, this one did not... Buyer beware"
"Amazon" "Me and my husband are in love! Huge phone awesome everything I must say only thing we didn't like is they didn't come with the wall part of the plug in"
"Amazon" "Nice cellphone."
"Amazon" "Please stay away from this deviceThe phone drops signal frequently..Unable to maintain a phone call while traveling"
"Amazon" "Very, but very close to perfect.It truly doesn’t look like any other phone you might have used before, and it’s refined and polished to a literal shine."
"Amazon" "In summary Phone arrived on time with the original seal intact. The performance is excellent. These three points are the most important for me.Five stars well done NGP Store USA."
"Amazon" "Wow what a phone.  Great service"
"Amazon" "Nice phone, looks like factory sealed, but i am very happy with my phone works with my swedish and US t mobile sim."
"Amazon" "Same as I expected, I like how they protected the cartoon for shipping to come nice and new"
"Amazon" "Very disappointed. I bought a S8+ Maple Gold but I got a black."
"Amazon" "Excelent work on Turkey. Internationel unlocked Phone. Thanks 😊"
"Amazon" "Wow, I was quite disappointed with this much anticipated phone.  I don't like the aspect ratio. Would prefer to have a wider screen. Phone is very long. Plus, the Samsung user interface is much changed from previous generations. Don't like it as well. Back side if very slick and shiny. Really shows the finger prints."
"Amazon" "Amazing"
"Amazon" "Beautiful phone"
"Amazon" "Awesome phone.i just loved it"
"Amazon" "Great"
"Amazon" "Just as described"
"Amazon" "Great"
"Amazon" "Paying almost 900 dollars for a phone and then some for a case you'd think it wouldn't break. My screen has shattered twice now. I've never broken a phone before in my life. I've never dropped this phone either. One minute it's fine and the next it's shattered. It was in my purse all day next to my cloth wallet. I never set my purse down nor did it get hit/leaned on/thrown/etc.. I pull out the phone and it's shattered. I'm so frustrated and angry that something this expensive would break for no apparent reason. TWICE. If I could give 0 stars, I would. This is absurd. I want my money back."
"Amazon" "Website stated Maple Gold item is Midnight Black very disappointed."
"Amazon" "Great size"
"Amazon" "Great phone with an incredible display I've been getting an awesome battery life sometimes up to 10 hours of screen on time"
"Amazon" "I have one se I love It."
"Amazon" "Amazing product. 10 times better then the S7.THE full screen is basicly one of the best idea. Seller was very helpful even on the phone with support. Very rarin buyers"
"Amazon" "I bought this smartphone 3 months ago, everything its working well but the the only detail is the smartphone is clonated it is not original and I am so mad  for that...if are u thinking to get this device just think twice....this is my worst experience ever about amazon"
"Amazon" "Must be the best phone about. Brilliant resolution on the screen and a lightening fast processor. So much better than my previous S5"
"Amazon" "great"
"Amazon" "great"
"Amazon" "I love it... sooo much...!"
"Amazon" "Prior to this terrible warrantee experience I am having I liked Samsung products. I have several in my home. However, when something goes wrong and you need to send the product in for service and repair, good luck!I purchased a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge earlier in the year after being a loyal iPhone user since the 3GS. When I made the switch I was pleasantly surprised how much I liked the phone. It worked flawlessly for about six months until a firmware update they release trashed the phone. Took it to a local Samsung rep. at Best Buy and he tried for a day and a half to replace the operating system with no luck. He said that it is still under warranty so send it in and they’ll fix it. Sounded great, however.I called their customer service number and they stared a claim, she took my information down and told me it will take around eleven days to get it back, then issued me a UPS label. I sent the phone off to them and they send me an email on June 27th confirming that they received the phone and issued me a ticket number. So far so good right?Well after the first week when by I decided to check the status of my repair through the Repair Self Tracking portal they have and was surprised to see that there was nothing in their system about my repair claim. Though to myself, that’s weird.On July 13th, after thirteen business days later of not hearing anything I called them again to check the status. They said that they were done with it but I gave them a P.O. Box address and that they can only delver to a physical address. Oh, ok I get it, a mistake. However, when the person who originally took my information shouldn’t she have told me that they required a physical address? Still, not too upset. They told me that they would ship it immediately and I would have it in 1-4 business days. Great? Not so fast.Five business days later on July 20th I still had not received my phone so I called again. The Samsung rep I talked to this time said pretty much the same thing that the last rep told me and that it has not been shipped. Now I’m irritated. I told him that they had the correct address now so what’s the problem?  He put me on hold and checked with the repair shop and a Anne told him that they would overnight it today and I would receive it tomorrow. This is where it gets really shady. I asked this person to please send me an email stating our conversation and confirming that the phone was being shipped overnight. He told me that they do not have the capability to send emails. What? Samsung can’t send emails? I was pissed off so I asked to speak to his supervisor. He put me on hold for a really long time and came back to tell me that his supervisor “Graham” will not speak with me and that he doesn’t have the capability to send an email either. Now I’m furious. I’m being lied to and this is getting really shady. I’m not sure they even have my phone at this point. He put me on hold again and talked to Anne again who told him that when they sip it later today, I would receive an email stating that it shipped. I was not happy and expressed it vividly.I then went on the web trying to find another number to contact or call someone above them all with no luck. So what I found is that if these people want to screw you over, there’s no one else to get involved or help. What a predicament.Later the same day (July 20th) I called again and talked to another representative name Angela. She checked the status and let me know that it shows on her end that my phone is scheduled to be shipped overnight and I should have tomorrow. I wasn’t holding my breath at this point.We’ll here I am now, today is July 26th and yes, still no phone. I am beyond upset and don’t know if I will ever get my phone back. I’m thinking I am going to have to get an attorney involved which will likely cost more than a new phone. I can tell you this, if this can happen to your phone, it can happen to all Samsung products. I will be switching back to an iPhone here shortly if I don’t get my phone by this Friday. I caution you to ever think about buying another product from Samsung again."

"Amazon" "I have heard so much about this Samsung 8 plus I also have seen commercials I have a lot of viewers on YouTube and I'm trying to show my YouTube videos that the Samsung 8 video phone is worth buying so could I please get this phone as a free sample to prove to my friends and my views on YouTube that Samsung is the best choice to go with thank you and have a great day"
"Amazon" "This is my second s8. I bought 1 for me and I loved it so much I bought one for my wife. She loved it. The price difference isn't much compared to buying it online or in the store. This is a really good phone"
"Amazon" "Phone is just as described. It is light and slim and so it's best to get a case for some added protection. Dual sim feature works fine (one sim 4G LTE and one sim 2G). I'm satisfied with this product except for the fact that it's battery life is not very good. With heavy usage, the battery will probably last around 4 to 5 hours. And with light usage (simple texting and some website browsing or video streaming), it can last for a day (8-12 hours). Definitely recommend this phone."

"Amazon" "Note: I am reviewing this phone based on its quality and functionality, and it's full suggested retail price of $750, and not based on price-gouging from these third-party re-sellers.A quick prologue: I had been laying low since buying two Samsung Galaxy S6 Edges in early 2015 (one gold, one white - yes, I loved it that much). I knew that it was the perfect phone for me at that time, and that based on how the cell phone evolution was going on then (early 2015), I knew the S7 Edge would be an iterative succession, and not a big leap forward. So I bought my S6 Edges with the thought in mind that I would have it for at least 2-3 years. My analysis was that Samsung at that point in time had plateaued their curved screen technology and philosophy, and would move on next to foldable screens by 2020. I gave them a couple of buffer years in case they didn't feel like introducing us to such drastic technology too early, as Samsung has a habit of forward thinking, yet holding back a year or two so they can milk the most money out of their current technologies. Fast forward to this year, and I have not been wrong - Samsung has indeed matured and plateaued its curved screen plans, but their foldable screen technology has not been up to speed, so it would be delayed for another year or two (they are still on track for 2020). With the introduction and quick adoption/popularity of HDR technology, they can afford to stay on their curved screen plan for another year or two until they lower the costs of their foldable screen technology down enough for mass production.I loved my S6 Edges, but I got bored of the gold one quickly, and sold it to buy a Rose Gold iPhone 6S last year, while keeping the white S6 Edge. I loved everything about it - mainly the beautiful curved screen design, but even more so, the awesome camera, which was the best for its time, and still holds up today as one of the very best in bright light. If you go through my reviews, 99% of the photos from 2015 on are from my S6 Edge. It is so good I have replaced my travel DSLR with it (I still use my Canon 5D Mark III for my serious projects), and all my Instagram photos are also from my S6 Edge (you can find the link to my IG on my Amazon profile).Sorry for the long intro, but it ties to my review that the camera on the S8 is even better. Do not be fooled by early hands-on articles that the rear camera is the same as the S7 Edge. It is NOT the same. It is a new camera system developed by Sony, and it is a dual-pixel system which takes two photos each time you press the shutter button, and quickly and deftly combines the two to give you an awesome final photo, which contains HDR and selective focus elements/photo modes. It excels in low light conditions, with its f1.7 aperature, and it even exceeds the S7 Edge's camera. It might not compete in fast action with the ridiculous 960 fps Sony camera in its new Xperia X phones, but for everyday use, I feel this is the best phone camera so far. It has electronic image stabilization (EIS), even up to 4K video recording, which is a first for phone cameras. The front (selfie) camera is also vastly improved, but not as good as the 13MP camera of the LG G6.This is a photography geek's review, leading in with the camera, but I know most of you are more concerned with the big beautiful screen, which it is exactly that. The resolution is 2960 x 1440 pixels, or a pixel density of 570 ppi. The technology is Samsung's very own OLED, called sAMOLED. It is the same basic technology that makes the best TV screens in LG's OLED TVs. Samsung's 2017 version is so good, it is apparently the best screen ever. You can read more technical specs from Display Mate:displaymate. com/Galaxy_S8_ShootOut_01.htm (erase the space between the dot com)How Samsung has managed to squeeze all that goodness into a phone this size is quite a technological marvel, and quite a gamble as well. Instead of the 16:9 ratio 95% of the phones out there today have, they have chosen on an 18.5:9 ratio, similar to LG G6's 18:9 ratio, but a little slimmer. So this is Samsung's way of truly trying to stand out from the crowd for this generation (year). Cinema (movie theatre) ratio is 21:9, so there truly is no video/film format that perfectly fits this screen's ratio. So there will be empty spaces around the videos and movies you watch, but the black bezels will help eliminate that disparity - note that all S8's, regardless of what color scheme, have black front bezels. Some of the apps have yet to be updated to this ratio, so some will not resize properly, or will have black bars on certain edges. But there is a resize/full screen option in the S8's settings to get around this for now until the app developers update their apps.This phone is actually more narrow than the S6/S6 Edge. The S8 measures 68.1mm wide by 8.1mm thick by 148.9mm tall, and weighs 155 grams, while the S6 Edge is 70.1 x 7 x 142.1 mm, and weighs 132 g. But as you can see it is a tick thicker, and noticeable taller and heavier. So although the S8 has a total footprint that is larger than the S6 Edge, or is actually easier and more comfortable to hold in one hand. For further comparisons, the iPhone 7 is 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1 mm (138 g), the iPhone 7 Plus is 158.2 x 77.9 x 7.3 mm (188 g), and the LG G6 is 148.9 x 71.9 x 7.9 mm (163 g). So it actually is easier to grasp in the hand than most other phones of similar size, only bested by the (much smaller) iPhone 7 (4.7-inch screen vs. 5.8-inch for the S8).The sound systems are also improved, as the speaker is louder and more clear, and the audio processing is much much better for listening to music with your earphones/headphones. However, it is still a mono speaker, not even stereo-immersive sound, and of course nowhere near as good as HTC's usual dual-speakers. Speaking of earphones, a pair of premium AKG earphones are included, which is the best factory-bundled earphones I have witnessed. It cannot compare to my Velodynes and Sennheisers, but it beats all other cheap generic bundled earphones. That reminds me, you should spend the extra $100 on the extra bundle, which in addition to the included VR headset, also includes a Samsun 256GB microSD card, and a pair of AKG Bluetooth headphones. Each sells for over $100, so you are actually saving a bunch: AKG Bluetooth Headphone Black (Y50BTBLK) Samsung EVO+ 256GB UHS-I microSDXC U3 Memory Card with Adapter (MB-MC256DA/AM).My S6 Edge worked fluidly and flawlessly in the first few month. But even with the top processor of the time, and 3GB of RAM, it slowed down as the memory neared the capacity, especially after the hundreds of photos began to pile up. The camera, once near instantaneous to turn on, now takes about a second. The S8, with its 4GB of RAM and either the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor or Samsung's own Exynos 8895 so far is doing an impeccable job. The Snapdragon 821, and even the 820, is fast enough for 2017, so having the 835 and the Exynos 8895 future-proofs it for another 2-3 years at least, since I feel with each successive processor, we are getting to the point where the hardware requirements for software is plateauing, and you would only need the latest processors for video games which keeps getting better and better and continually needs the fastest processor. I think once we reach 6GB of RAM, any processor beyond the 835/8895 should be fast enough for every day apps of the next 10 years.In totality, this is the first phone since the S6 Edge that I got really excited about, and with the rumored OLED iPhone coming out this year, 2017 should be a great year for fans of both sides to upgrade. If you don't mind the $750+ price, you can't go wrong with the Samsung Galaxy S8. It is an investment that should last a few years, or at least until those foldable screen phones come out...."
"Amazon" "I bought the S8 Dual SIM from TechnoMaster. Arrived promptly. Included were S8, USA charger, USB C cable, USB C to Standard USB adapter, USB C to Micro adapter, earphones and extra ear buds. S8 was 50% charged out of the box. Everything works like a charm and I highly recommend TechnoMaster as the vendor - especially since some got a European charger instead of a USA charger. Also bought a Seneo Fast Wireless Charger and a Spigen Tough Armor Galaxy S8 case. Fast Wireless Charger works perfectly with the S8 in the Spigen case.International Dual Sim S8's do not support Wifi Calling, which is sad. Not having removable battery is also sad - my S4 had that feature. S8 is a bit slippery to the touch so I really recommend a good case. Right now I have a 128GB micro SD card in the second SIM slot. I used the S8's Smart Switch to transfer all Samsung data (including phone contacts) from my S4 to the S8 using the provided USB cable and adapter. Had to install Smart Switch on the S4 from the Play Store. Everything worked like a charm.So far I am a happy camper."
"Amazon" "Phone came with all accessory's and brand new i was skeptic but after much research I was satisfied. I have one complaint the charger was a European one i ended up buying a Samsung Fast Charger EP-TA20JBE . Overall phones is very quick , clean a bit smaller than i expected but im upgrading from another dual sim Blu viva xl so clearly everything was a vast upgrade lol . Phone came on time and i live in the Caribbean and it works great just remember you cant use 2 sims and a sd card you must choose either 2 sims or 1 sim and your sd card. Will update if i experience any problems."
"Amazon" "Arrived on time and the phone was as expected, brand new and working perfectly."
"Amazon" "This phone came exactly as advertised and has worked great with no issues. My SIM card also worked with no additional steps needing to be taken to configure the phone."
"Amazon" "Really has to be the best smartphone out there apart from possibly the iPhone X, but this is much cheaper and it has dual sim capability which works so well and easily. The size is perfect - amazing screen, and easy to hold and operate with one hand, although the all glass front and back is slippery so it is best with a skin or a case. Battery life is great and easily lasts an entire day of moderate to heavy use. Really can't fault it and this, coming from an Apple devotee."
"Amazon" "Beware, NO Warranty For A reason. Had the phone working fine, brand new. Took 2 pictures under 1/2 meter of water, the phone is not properly sealed. As per seller, \"iIt is not made to be submerged\", but as per SAMSUNG Specs: IP68 means it can be submerged for pics at 1 .5 meters for up to 30 Minutes!!!I suspect these phones may be either rejects (poorly sealed or some other defect), or clones.SAVE you $$, but from someplace reputable, WITH A GUARANTEE!!"
"Amazon" "Thanks to the seller, I was able to try this phone out and review it.  Several months after the Galaxy's S8 launch, Samsung’s new Bixby virtual assistant is fully available though still hit or miss, and we’re not fans of the fingerprint sensor’s location.  The edges are a bit curved, so it may seem like something out of a sci-fi movie!  Overall, the phone is in great packaging and shape. One of , if not the best phones you can bu!"
"Amazon" "Great phone works well good battery works well with att and runs apps without problems lots of options and settings also has ability to extend battery and would also help keep phone from overheating if you chose those settings as it helps to limit component speed which will not run as hot."
"Amazon" " I've bought this phone only  2 months ago. Recently, after only 15-20 minutes of use the screen starts flekering and is impossible to use the phone. In the same time the phone heats up fast."
"Amazon" "Great phone, dual SIM works perfect and I've SIM's from two different countries."
"Amazon" "The phone was beautiful and came in original packaging however if it was dual sim capable as advertised I could not confirm (did not have the dual sim holder but the regular one) and most importantly it would not connect to ANY US carrier (even AT&T).  Tried all major carriers at there licensed locations.  I spoke to customer service and they said it was a defect in the phone and to return it."
"Amazon" "LOVE THIS PHONE. It came with usb cable, hub, earphone, extra ear buds & the two little things like A usb.However it wasn't unlocked to Metro pcs like it said it would.  I had pay to unlock it. Apart from that I absolutely love my new midnight s8!!!"
"Amazon" "Dual SIM works perfectly for T-Mobile and AT&TT-Mobile: 4G, 3GAT&T: 3G, 2G"
"Amazon" "Perfect! Great price, fast delivery and amazing phone. Very happy customer."
"Amazon" "good"
"Amazon" "OK"
"Amazon" "Absolutely terrible location for the fingerprint reader.  On the back of the phone by the camera!  Stupid!  A real pain in the ass.  The operating system is bloated with too many bells and whistles.  A simpler more intuitive interface like Android Oxygen on my old Oneplus 3 would be much better.  Last if you buy this phone, which is the international phone, you cannot register it with your American Samsung Account you have to open a European Account.  I wish I had bought a Oneplus 5 or the Samsung 7."
"Amazon" "Broken after 1 week of use.Pretty fragile"
"Amazon" "Bought this phone a month ago..it has beenamazing until 3 days ago. The back camera became blurry, thought it may have been the app I was using so I switched to the phone's camera...still blurry. After doing some research some people were saying to do a hard reset or shake it...did a hard reset..worked a day..then became blurry again..tried shaking it..and it worked fine for only half a day."
"Amazon" "too many issues, needs a lot of restarting"
"Amazon" "I don't know what happened but when I got home in Brazil and I opened the box the phone does not start and does not charge. Now I am overseas and here I have no support even from Amazon even from Samsung. What do. You suggest to me?"
"Amazon" "Great cell phone"
"Amazon" "A lot of technology in one of the handset."
"Amazon" "Wil my T-Mobile son card work for this phone?"
"Amazon" "Beware of international version! I recieved a sealed S8 package. Inside the package was a plastic dummy S7 toy phone! It was an unreal experience."
"Amazon" "works great as expected."
"Amazon" "Best performing phone out there!"
"Amazon" "Great phone"
"Amazon" "Excellent phone, but the location of the finger reader too bad"
"Amazon" "I bought this phone because of the beautiful screen and left behind my not to old Iphone 6s, after 2 days of using, the screen was real good, the only thing that made me change side, but that screen with gorila glass 5, supposed to be the hardest screen ever. Here is the thing it got broken after a fall from not more than 15\".I had my phone with a screen protector and a case and the result was a screen broken.Dont buy it unless you have a military case that make your phone ugly, not the reason to buy a phone lile this.Im realy sad."
"Amazon" "its fake its not even the real deal. sad"
"Amazon" "Excellent!!!"
"Amazon" "very very nice quality, use it for awhile now, everything is great.... fast speed, nice screen resolution"
"Amazon" "Really wanted to give this phone 5 stars. I bought the international version and received it a couple days ago however, when I plugged in my headphones they do not work. The head phone works with other phones and the phone works with other headphones  but they do not work together. I really had high expectations"
"Amazon" "Ok so far"
"Amazon" "great phone awesome display"
"Amazon" "loving it, no issues so far."
"Amazon" "the phone is silver not gold like i orderd but as long as it does the same features im good with it1"
"Amazon" "Charger is for UK, so have to get new one if you plan to use in Europe. But phone is great"
"Amazon" "Very disappointed. I bought a S8+ Maple Gold but I got a Silver."
"Amazon" "Excelente!"
"Amazon" "Great big screen phone."
"Amazon" "Nice"
"Amazon" "Best and fastest cellphone as of now. I love it, big screen powerful yet compact and lightweight."
"Amazon" "I've used a lot of Galaxy phones so far. My last one was S6 Edge+, I didn't think Samsung can produce something that tops it, but they've apparently done it. The S8+ is by far the best phone I've used so far - very fast, nicely looking, and the iris recognition is awesome. Saves you a lot of time and frustration as you can use it for business and not have to enter long passwords, which are typically required by your enterprise administrators. Awesome handset!"
"Amazon" "The product didn't have its original charger"
"Amazon" "The phone came in promptly. As others have stated, I too questioned if the phone was a fake or not because it did not come with the Samsung S8+ logo on the back, it just says Samsung with a printed label attached with the model number and IMEI on it.Pros- In all its a good phone.  Samsung did well and always has. The picture quality is like no other.  The screen is sleek and call and music quality is great.Cons-This phone has locked features that are displayed in Chinese. I can not remove and make it English. The phone also will not pair to any Bluetooth device. The only reason I have not sent it back was because even though I had a gorilla glass screen on the phone.  Within the first 5 hours of my using it, my umbrella hit the phone in a spot that was not protected by the gorilla glass and cracked my screen leaving a visible chip near the speaker on top. So I have a chipped screen and it does not connect to Bluetooth that I need. Because the phone is the \"Asian\" version, I also can't use Samsung pay because the United States is not one of the selected country options listed on this phone. Just not a happy girl. I should have just waited for the Note 8.If anyone knows how to change the internal setting to make it an English version and to help with the Bluetooth connection. Please help!"
"Amazon" "This is the most fantastic phone I have ever owned. Great software makes operation easy and intuative"
"Amazon" "Good till now"
"Amazon" "Nice phone but swallows battery life"
"Amazon" "The phone start frezzing and buggin 4 days after purchase. Beware that unlocked cellphones do not have a warranty."
"Amazon" "In my second year at university which I am studying engineering as it relates to computer.  I have a Facebook page where I  promote cool gadget from your company.  I would love a free sample of this product that my friends and others can see."
"Amazon" "Many useful new functions then Galaxy 7 Edge such as Iris Recognition, Keyboard Setup, Always On, Home Recognition.I was very used to Google interface if you install \"Google Now\" it replaces Bixby interface.."
"Amazon" "I bought this phone for my high school senior, and he LOVES it! He's a Straight \"A\" student (who deserved this Awesome phone) and a tech geek so when I say he LOVES it I TRUST his perspective."
"Amazon" "Works flawlessly! My only complain is that the charger it came with doesn't work. Can you please replace this?"
"Amazon" "such a wonderful product that I may order another one"
"Amazon" "Beautiful.Best of the best. Kudos to samsung"
"Amazon" "I am very satisfied with my purchase, the only thing I did not like was to wait 15 days to receive the package."
"Amazon" "Yes it new at first i thought is was fake so i did some researches on The samsung galaxy s8 plus. It  is a uk version only the American version does have  Samsung Galaxy S8 written in the back of it"
"Amazon" "It was a gift for my son and he loves it."
"Amazon" "Got the phone and Samsung duos was written on the back!!!! What the heck is this, and no one is responding to me fast enough."
"Amazon" "I love my new S8+.  Brand new I would recommend this to anyone!"
"Amazon" "Just what the wife wanted for her birthday.  Great gift ... good price."
"Amazon" "Great phone. It came with a charging adapter from Asia and the seller sent an US adapter. It works well"
"Amazon" "One of the best phones I've had"
"Amazon" "Ok!"
"Amazon" "My wife Lovve's it"
"Amazon" "It is simple to navigate. Feels good in the hand. Elegant design."
"Amazon" "Love this phone. Thanks Samsung"
"Amazon" "Great phone best ive ever had"
"Amazon" "Highly recommend! Prompt delivery and everything is within our expectation!"
"Amazon" "Superb!!!! Works like a violin."
"Amazon" "Great phone! Lover it!"
"Amazon" "They gave me the double sim. I wanted the simple sim model."
"Amazon" "Excellent"
"Amazon" "Phone is fake. Was in samsung store and they confirmed"
"Amazon" "I'm very disappointed. I ordered a international phone and it said on the box to use only a American SIM card. Needless to say, I had to return the phone. What's the point of ordering a INTERNATIONAL phone if that's the case."
"Amazon" "The mobile is nice, however i was expecting to receive the marple gold color.. but actually i've received the arctic gray colorl"
"Amazon" "Great phone! The best!"
"Amazon" "I love it"
"Amazon" "Easy to install. Came safely."
"Amazon" "It got some sample"
"Amazon" "very nice Toy and functional"
"Amazon" "The phone is great, the type of earphones included are useless.  As far as technology has come, why were earphones better 30 years ago....."
"Amazon" "So in love with my phone."
"Amazon" "I LOVE IT!!"
"Amazon" "perfect"
"Amazon" "Excellent phone!"
"Amazon" "I have had my Samsung Galaxy 8 plus for two weeks. The screen images are crystal clear and I can easily see images with the large 6.2 inch display. While it is a good phone, I can't find anything to justify paying over a thousand dollars after tax and accessories."
"Amazon" "fantastic!!!"
"Amazon" "Amazon sells these phones without a US recognized IMEI identification number."
"Amazon" "I would like to have a free sample"
"Amazon" "Phone is heavy and too large, but if this is what you want then here it is. Is is very fast and so far seems like good quality (no battery issues yet). I am not sure it is worth anywhere near the price. I also have an Honor phone that was $500 less and it seems just as good"
"Amazon" "Just received in the mail and cannot connect to sprint i think it is due to the fact that the phone came with no apn whatsoever can anyone help?"
"Amazon" "This phone doesn't have LTE Band 12 for T-Mobile.  A shame because the Exynos variants will most likely be faster."
"Amazon" "I am completely happy with my purchase and recommend this Amazon Supplier!  I would purchase from this company again!Thanks so much!Mike"
"Amazon" "Never buy other Samsung anything. Phone been nothing but problems.  TOP it off today it decided to factory reset its self... needless to say wasn't a good day."
"Amazon" "Love everything about this phone. Gorgeous screen. The edge feature takes getting used to but is very useful. The new interface is just about perfect. Having waited a while to upgrade from S5 to S8+, I'm finding enough new or improved functionality to make me feel great about the cost of upgrading. This is an absolutely beautiful phone. You almost hate to cover it with a case or protector. But i got a clear case from Speck (Presidio Clear) that still shows it off very nicely, not too hard to keep free of fingerprints. Purchased both the phone and case at Verizon store. Bought film protector (glass doesn't seem to have been solved yet due to curved screen) but the model on Amazon under the following name worked like a charm for me, plus it's a 2 pack in case you mess up.Galaxy S8 Plus Screen Protector [2-Pack], iTURBOS Full Screen Coverage 3D PET HD Screen Protector Film for Samsung Galaxy S8 PlusAs for the phone itself... Wow. There are some really neat improvements to the launcher, everything feels truly improved. The calendar app feels like it comes from the future. It's fast, you can multi task, the notification window is so much more versatile (reply to texts without leaving the video you're watching... It plays behind the notification screen while you reply if you so desire).Cannot recommend highly enough. The larger screen takes a little bit of getting used to, the s5 definitely wasn't a phablet by any means, but the adjustment is worth the extra screen size and resolution.They moved the speaker and the headphone jack to the bottom of the phone. Be nicer if the speakers were on the face somehow, but this is much better than the back speaker design of S5. The natural position of your hand in a one hand hold cups the audio back at you. Having the head back on the bottom keeps the cord out of your screen. Great great great.Still get your SD card slot (be careful, it's a delicate but stubborn little thing), but I'm nowhere needing it. While i was constantly at less than 25% memory on my S5 even after using SD for pics videos and any apps that allowed. I've got an SD in there now, but haven't used it. I've loaded twice as many apps on this as on my S5 (where I'd always go web versus app if possible) and I just today cracked the 50% mark on internal storage - including every pic and video that used to be on my S5's SD. From now on, I'm planning to treat the SD as a back up for pics etc until further notice. If I'm at 50%with more apps than I'll ever actually regularly use, I'll be set for a good stretch. This all tells me that Samsung did a great job streamlining three bloat. Indeed, while there was some typical preinstall junk, I was​ able to delete a surprising amount of what I didn't want.Camera seems great. Gallery is neat, it'll go through and put together little photo montages for you based on date and location. Not sure how useful it'll turn out to be, but it's a neat attempt at something new.Yeah, listen, I rarely go crazy in a product review, but if you're at all on the fence whether to upgrade or if to go with this over another phone? Buy this phone. It is beautiful, functional, and constantly surprises."
"Amazon" "I have had this phone for 4 days now..  There are a few things I want to bring to everyone attention.Attach are some photos.Background:  I didn't get the phone from Amazon, I got it from Samsung directly.  I have used Note 4, Samsung S5, Nexus 6 and Samsung S7.  Generally I prefered bigger phone.1.)  Screen definitely is nice, colors are vivid and sharp.2.)  I didn't notice the issue on the first day.  However, I noticed with some charging issues on 3rd.  First, it would RANDOMLY - NOT/STOP charge after charing for awhile, ranging from 70% to 86% then stop, or from 26% to 36% than become SLOW / standard charge.  However, the indicator on the screen showed \"Fast Charging\".  I monitored it for a few days.  I used the app Ampere to measure it.  Sometimes I get 0 mA for 45 min.  At slow charge, I see 72 mA to 150 mA.  At the fast charge, it usually at around 1010 mA.  I remember on the first day, it went as high as 1420 mA.  I can confirm the issue. Yes, I use all genuine Samsung charger and cable.  It is a new phone, got to do that.  No, I don't have too much apps on background.  Even if I do, it should still charge, at least all the previous phones I have do.  To resolve the issue, I have to either unplug and replug it back in.  Or a restart the phone.  it is totally annoying.  I am not sure if it can be corrected by firmware update..3.)  It actually totally freezed!!  I was browsing the web, and suddenly the phone doesn't response.  The power button doesn't work, volume doesn't work, no botton works.  I have to do force reset.  Out of the 10 years I used a smart phone.  I never experienced freeze.  I can feel the lag, but not freeze.4.) I like bigger screen phones better.  In terms of size, the S8 plus just a little too narrow for big phone.  I understand that it can be operated by one hand better, but having used to Note 4 and Nexus 6 size.  I find that the S8 Plus doesn't work well, at least to me.5.)  Edge screen - It is nice, but I think it is more for marketing than actual functionality.  Without a case, I find that my fingers would touch the edge, and making it not every responsive, because I have at least 3 or 4 fingers on the screen.  the OS doesn't know how to react with more than 2 fingers..6.)  May be do to incident of the Note 7, now even as fast charge, the phone doesn't feel as hot.  It is a good improvement for safety.  It is cooler than the Nexus 4 and Note 4 when fast charging.."
"Amazon" "Recently switched from a 7 Plus to S8 Plus and I'm glad I did. IPhone feels too restrictive. S8 Plus has a headphone jack so no need to spend on wireless headphones or adapters to plug in headphones and charger at the same time, no need to plug in to a computer to get music or videos, tons more apps available, and design is fantastic. Almost same size as 7 Plus yet huge difference in screen size due to infinity display. Not an apple fanboy at all. Samsung all the way!"
"Amazon" "This is a great Android phone but within the first couple days of ownership/usership, I see many scratches on the screen and edges. I am a gentle user. So, after noticing the imperfections, a micro panic attic followed. (Not my preciousez!) Immediately, I placed the phone in a dust free, lint free, freak out free environment and ordered a screen protector. 4 out of 5 stars because my baby is marred for life."
"Amazon" "The phone is overall a powerful phone with a very sleek design. I love the way it feels and the high definition display is amazing. But there are NO quality screen protectors for this 6.2 inch beautiful display... either you get a TPU screen protector that literally fogs the display, or a glass screen protector that doesn't cover the infinity screen, and doesn't stay on. It's awful! The phone has been out long enough now, someone should have cornered the market by now on a decent screen protector for the s8 plus. The phone is great, but still buggy... They're still updating, but I really expected more."
"Amazon" "Came in great condition. I love this phone! I'm using it through straight talk wireless."
"Amazon" "nice upgrade from S4.  its fragile so get a case and tempered glass that wraps around the touch screen.  screen is hard to see in bright sunlight and the sound is very loud with my high end ear buds.  it takes some time to learn features but very easy to use.  good speed and so far i like the fingerprint security but it takes a couple of scans to unlock.  S memo is gone but the notes app is still useful if you keep short notes on the phone, can be shared as pdf."
"Amazon" "Amazing phone!"
"Amazon" "Great phone, arrived a day earlier than promised"
"Amazon" "Five Star"
"Amazon" "Phone arrived fast and looks brand new so far 100% satisfied I was very skeptical for the price I paid."
"Amazon" "Exactly as described and arrived super fast!!!!Excellent communication & HIGHLY RECOMMENDED would do business with again,  Thank  you"
"Amazon" "This phone is stuck on the Verizon logo loading page. I cannot power it off and restart it. It will not progressed past the Verizon logo. It appears you can't remove the battery. And, it doesn't use this standard charger. You'd have to get all new Chargers if you are traditionally used to using Android products. Not happy with this purchase at all! Definitely needed a new phone for a once-in-a-lifetime hiking Adventure. Now I don't have time to get a new phone and I'm highly disappointed and heartbroken. Plus, I purchased a waterproof case for this phone and I have to return it now as well and pay postage of almost $7. This has not been a good experience all the way around."
"Amazon" "Nice options. Quick action phone."
"Amazon" "I immediately fell in love with this phone.Also, the shipping came faster than what I thought."
"Amazon" "Great phone, super fast."
"Amazon" "perfect"
"Amazon" "works and looks new, couldnt ask for anything better from a used refurbished product."
"Amazon" "It was linked to another account so I could not activate it."
"Amazon" "Amazing, falled in love in the first minute on. Attached with my DeX on my desk, even better."
"Amazon" "Great one"
"Amazon" "Love love my phone it's perfect!"
"Amazon" "Best phone ever!"
"Amazon" "Awesome!"
"Amazon" "I require dual Sim phones so I can keep my personal number and work number without carrying to phones.  The dual Sim functionality on this handset is substantially superior to others I've used. The performance is perfect and esthetically it's a work of art. The battery life with heavy usage is middle of the road, but it charges very quickly. My only minor gripe is the off center placement of the fingerprint scanner, but muscle memory makes it a non issue after a short amount of time. I'm very happy with my purchase.Also, I'm recommending this seller to any of my friends or work colleagues that are looking to purchase a phone."
"Amazon" "Best phone I ever bought.24 October 2017:After nearly one month of having my new Samsung Galaxy S8 SM-G950FD (MAPLE GOLD), I am very pleased.First point I would like to make is that I bought this phone through another source, not the supplier listed in this ad. About the same price and the phone came directly from Hong Kong. The phone is made in Vietnam.I upgraded from my Galaxy Avant phone which I have had for two years. Still a great phone, but I have outgrown it and need a phone that is more technologically advanced.This phone works on GSM network, NOT CDMA. Europe networks are GSM so either you buy this phone and change to a provider in the U.S. that uses GSM, or do not buy this phone.The phone’s backing has a beautiful copper-gold casing and the glass front displays photo, web browsing, and texting very well. It has a nice bright screen to view and it is easier on my eyes than with my old Avant.My phone provider is Metro PCS. I have been a customer of theirs since 2011 and I loved their service and network. They provide GSM network so the day that I got my new phone, my customer rep at my local PCS store got my phone hooked up in less than ten minutes. I had to buy a new SIM for $15.00 and he charged me a $15.00 service fee for adding this phone to my plan. No biggie, small cost. I have a unlimited data plan so I added the $10.00 a month unlimited texting and 200 call minutes to my buddy in France. The only drawback is that Metro does not have roaming in France yet, so when I am in France, I will need to buy a separate SIM for my new phone. No problem, I’ll just buy an Orange SIM card and be set.This phone is a superior to my Avant. This phone is user-friendly and its functionalities are incredible. It took me about two days to get used to its new interface. The phone turns on fast, it charges very fast, and it keeps a charge for a very long time and I can go for about two days, depending on how my use.Apps: I am uploading new apps and not cloning my Avant to this one. I want to start fresh because some apps I do not want and I do not want to clone the issues from my old phone also. Also, I am not going to use AVG or Norton this time. This phone has McAfee. Will I keep it? Yes as long as it does not bog down the OS. I have added 20 additional apps and this phone is not running any slower than when I first got it and it does not seem to have any issues.A note about my apps. I added two apps that my S8 recognized, accepted, and immediately began working that my Avant had problems using. The first one is the Rheem Econet app which is connected to my new Rheem water heater. I had difficulty getting my Galaxy Avant to recognize and connect to my wi-fi using this app and on some days, it would take me up to three hours to connect. My S8 recognized the app and my wi-fi in seconds and it works flawlessly. Also, I have security camera system on my house and I use the IP Cam Viewer app. Again, my S8 recognized the app, my wi-fi-and security passcode in seconds. The rest of the apps were easy to update as well.The camera on this phone astonishes me with its quality. I have been an avid amateur photographer since I was a kid and I do not believe in using camera phones for anything but play, but the camera on this phone is incredible. The colorization, smoothness, and lack of noise in my pictures makes it hard for me to want to get out my DSLR Nikon, lol.My phone packaged came with a universal electrical adaptor but it is not the European two-prong adapter, but the adapter with two angled slots that look like a “V”. It also came with a USB-C cord, a small USB-C adapter, and the USB-C connector adapter for transferring files from an old phone to this new phone.I have not used Bixby yet, but plan too in the future.The Google GPS map worked flawlessly and my phone reception is flawless also.I bought a rubberized phone protector with a screen saver.I am not using the fingerprint identifier for access but a four-digit pin code. Just easier for me.I will update this post later, but as of right now, it was worth every penny. I am hoping this phone will last me a good five years."
"Amazon" "Absolutely love it. I am glad I went with the S 8 over the S 7.  Easy to use and so many options. The unlocked is so much better.  Don't forget it comes with Europe plug."
"Amazon" "I received my phone with a European charger but no converter! I have a phone that I can’t charge! Not a happy camper! How is it an international version without a converter??"
"Amazon" "I love! Spectacular phone."
"Amazon" "Excellent product!... I travel a lot, just switch bands between numbers for data and it works flawless!... good looking phone with great features!"
"Amazon" "Good and ontime delivery"
"Amazon" "They do not prominently state that the phone cannot be used with verizion or sprint then you have to pay to return the phone"
"Amazon" "I purchased this phone few days ago. Delivery was quick.  Phone is really nice, unlocked and everything works great. But one thing is here no European charger. So I'm not able to charge my phone. And I need to buy charger for it saperately.  Which is no good. Is only way to charge this phone is using a laptop."
"Amazon" "Even after a boating accident completely submerged for about 25 minutes....  Still worked as if nothing ever happened.  I happened to have the QR charger for it... and used that to charge after the incident..... but this phone is so smart... when I plugged it in about a day or two later a warning message came up saying that it detected moisture inside and to wait to charge it.  Seeings how that could have been an electrical hazard... I was quite impressed!!!!"
"Amazon" "Just fantastic. This phone out performs the competition on every level. I've heard a lot of complaints about where the finger print scanner is, but these reviwers must not have actually held this device. Once you hold it in your hand your index finger goes exactly where the finger print scanner is! So just use your index instead of thumb, it is incredibly natural and I actually find it faster to use than my previous s6 with its scanner in the front.The phone is faster than fast and handles everything with ease. Most impressive is its long battery life, my previous phones used to die halfway thro the day, this thing still has 30-40% juice left at the end if a very long day.Screen is great, the software is optimized. I love every aspect of this. A real professional's work. You will be more productive with this tool."
"Amazon" "Received on time in excellent packing conditions.  FINALLY, I purchased a phone from Amazon that said it was \"new\" and it is!  This is the 3rd one that I had to buy to have that happen.  The other 2 sellers listed their phones as new and when they arrived the seal was broken or totally taken off all together.  The first guy actually put a new sticker that said \"do not accept if seal is broken\" over top of the original \"broken\" sticker.  The second guy just removed the sticker altogether so there wasn't a sticker at all.  I've bought a slew of Samsung phones over the years and I knew what to expect, but if you didn't know, you would probably wouldn't realize the difference.  BUT, having said that, this phone came brand new with the unbroken sticker. It is working perfectly (albeit is only 1 day old now).  The color is quite pretty and I think both men & women will like it."
"Amazon" "i had not realized phones had progressed this far.  this phone is much more configurable than any i had in the past.  i was reading a review of the next new iphone, and this phone already has all the features that were mentioned.  why pay over $1000 for a phone that women carry in their back pocket and sit on? i love that the fingerprint feature can unlock the phone, and some apps that require a login.  my boss was looking at the phone, and was gaga over the camera.  he discovered the zoom feature, and loved it.  i asked t-mobile about the cost of a card, and paid $26.  was told that yes, i could move to other network providers without having to purchase a new phone every time i moved.  purchased a metal case, worrying that the quick charge feature would not work, but it does.  the battery is extraordinary.  holds 8 hours without significant decay, and with the quick charger, will go to full charge in 15 minutes or so.  i purchased the quick charger at the phone store, and found it very convenient.  just lay the phone on it, and done."
"Amazon" "No comments just enjoy and take full advantage of this premium smart phone."
"Amazon" "Best cellphone ever"
"Amazon" "Extremely well made with outstanding appearance."
"Amazon" "I perches the phone for my son and his is thrilled excellent choice Dad .. as he was telling m about all the great features of the phone !! The delivery was fast the price was right !! The fast charging for North America was not included!!"
"Amazon" "Awkward compared to the s7 edge. Larger screen but never fills out completely anyway so it's a waste."
"Amazon" "They did not send the purchased model, the model received is a single SIM card. An Italian model, It is very annoying, since for me it is indispensable to use two cell lines. (2 Sim Card's)"
"Amazon" "this cell turns on but this cracked a cracked is very visible and the other will not return the cell phone for the reason that in the product said  92% positive and never scared that it was cracked"
"Amazon" "Faked phone. The phone received was a faked copy. It was not an original Samsung galaxy S8+ phone"
"Amazon" "Best smartphone out there in the market for sure."
"Amazon" "I liked it but some apps are came with Korean version, i hope the device also fro korean but seems to samsung pay is not working. Apart from that delivery and other things are good."
"Amazon" "Just perfect"
"Amazon" "GREAT looking phone!"
"Amazon" "I bought this equipment with international unlocking. I brought it to Peru and it worked for a month. Then I stop working, I talked to the seller and he told me that he had no guarantee. I called samsung and was told that the sim card slot is damaged and that they could not help me because the equipment was bought in Singapore. such an expensive team and nobody gave me a solution"
"Amazon" "Excellent  product 100% recommended"
"Amazon" "Love the blue color a lot!"
"Amazon" "It's awesome. I got mine two weeks ago and it's works great. I'm not lying. At first I had to ask questions to see if it works etc and it does. I have Tmoble."
"Amazon" "everything was good! highly recommended"
"Amazon" "Everything ok"
"Amazon" "useful！！！"
"Amazon" "Product stated when purchased it came in original box with wall charger and data cable, neither of which were provided, have yet to try phone as it is a gift."
"Amazon" "8-13-17: Why 4 stars and not 5?  This phone is amazing!  The screen, the infinity screen!  The last phone that impressed me with its incredible screen to body ratio was the LG G3.  With very little bezel, the Amoled display technology is bar none the best screen of all phones out right now.  The advancement in the S8 is stunningly impressive.  Sparking my excitement with technology and advancement, Samsung is a passionate company that doesn't like to hold back and listens to consumers. I'm truly a trusting fan -- and I have to admit, as much as iPhones are innovative, my displeasure with Apple is towards it's withholding of technology to make a buck off of you and me.  Samsung doesn't seem to withhold much.  The iPhone is still a relevant phone due to its established brand, but if you were to compare toe to toe with the Samsung S8 and S8 Plus, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus just doesn't compare and would appear to be a 2 year old phone compared to the advancements of the S8 and S8 Plus.  The tech on this phone is ahead of all phones presently out in the market now.  So why my 4 stars?  Well, just like Star Wars, which I'm a big fan, the S8, unfortunately has its own Jar Jar Binks features that just is annoying and I cannot ignore.1) Bixby -- I'm hoping that Samsung has big plans up its sleeves to devote an entire hardware button to an underdeveloped assistant that arguably, no one's heard of.  It's completely useless to me.  It just doesn't make sense to me as a consumer.  The only saving grace I have is a glimpse of a hope that Samsung knows what they are doing.  But this special hardware button devoted to Bixby is wasted in my opinion on what is otherwise a killer phone.  It's a blemish that holds the phone back from being the greatest phone.2) Finger print reader button -- what the heck Samsung?!  I know the iris scanner works extremely well, but after using this phone for over a month now,  I have to say, I miss my old S7 and S7 Edge, or Note 5 and even the S6 Edge fingerprint home key.  I really do!  On my S7, S7 Edge, and Note 5, even the S6 Edge, I pressed on the home key and the phone is unlocked, the fingerprint ready was flawless.  On this S8, I could use the fingerprint scanner, but it's so oddly placed that I struggle to stretch my hand/finger long enough to reach it . I find myself sliding my index finger around the camera, infrared scanner, and fingerprint scanner aimlessly, until very often I have to flip the phone over to see where my finger is at. I know right?  It feels completely clumsy and awkward.  Or if I use the iris scanner, which credit to Samsung works extremely well, but I'm required to press the power button, swipe the screen to access the camera to scan my iris, and place the phone in front of me (3 inefficient steps to access my phone from the most advanced phone in the market?).  There's something wrong with that and a major design flaw.  In design and engineering, just because it's new tech doesn't mean it's practical, or in other words new tech still needs the right application to make it usable.  Samsung missed it here.  I assume though that Samsung is hard at work on an onscreen finger print reader which would solve this problem. But reality is this S8 completely sucks because of this.  And it's not a like a feature that I use sparingly.  It's everytime I need to access my phone!  Ugh!  So, just like Star Wars, we love it, and try to forget Jar Jar Binks.Other than these strong annoyances, the phone's other innovations and advancements forces me to overlook the flaws and try to love this phone.  Listen to what I must say now:  I got this phone on a Best Buy promo through Verizon, with $300 off, so the total I paid was $420 minus a $30 rewards coupon - which brings my total to $390 plus tax.  For that price, it's a quality and value buy.  But considering the Jar Jar Binks affect of this phone, I wouldn't have plunge the full price -- no way! Also, I chose the S8 over the S8 Plus because I felt the S8 Plus was just too big, but others will argue that the size of the S8 Plus is better.  If it weren't for the deep promo, I would've continued happily using my S7, S7 Edge and Note 5, while waiting patiently for the S9 iteration.  I am anxious to see the Note 8.  Back to the S8, the infinity display is killer at an incredibly bright and beautiful at 5.8 inches, QuadHDplus super Amoled 2960x1440 570dpi.  I'm not a professional photographer and I only care about picture quality as far as my normal eyes can see, and this phone takes amazingly clear and vibrant pictures and video.  It's easy to access and the shutter speed is fast.  I love the panoramic picture feature and the wide angle is really handy.  The power and power management on this phone is extremely impressive, easily lasting the entire work day for me -- usability is snappy, fluid, clear, beautiful -- gliding on butter the apps and touch response runs with ease and the 4GB of memory manages multitasking on my phone is flawless -- I've noticed no lags or glitches, credit to Samsung for it's touchwiz software refinements interacting with Nougat 7.  I use my phone for work and play, everyday, google maps, work and personal email, shopping, taking pictures, voice and video calls on skype, viber and line.  I also have Sideline and google voice to manage an extra lines and texting.  I watch Youtube and listen to music on my LG bluetooth and streaming in my car bluetooth.  The smartphone to me is essential to my daily.  So, bottom line, this phone is incredibly advanced and anyone who is considering a new phone should have no doubt in getting the Samsung S8.  Despite its advancements, including IP68 Dust and Water resistance, Wireless Charging and Quick Charge 3.0, expandable storage with already 64GB built in, and all of this phone's grand advancements, Jar Jar Binks still lingers with me, plaguing my overall day to day enjoyment of this amazing phone.  4 stars for you.Buying this phone at a discount made it a quality and value buy.  I look forward to on screen fingerprint readers -- while I'm still debating whether I like iris scanning or not.  For now my verdict is no, at least not for unlocking my phone.  I prefer fingerprint unlocking.  Practically speaking, fingerprint scan, works better when I'm driving, at work with clients, etc.  Iris scanning can be better applied towards unlocking sensitive information on my phone, but not to unlock my phone."
"Amazon" "Note: I am reviewing this phone based on its quality and functionality, and it's full suggested retail price of $750, and not based on price-gouging from these third-party re-sellers.A quick prologue: I had been laying low since buying two Samsung Galaxy S6 Edges in early 2015 (one gold, one white - yes, I loved it that much). I knew that it was the perfect phone for me at that time, and that based on how the cell phone evolution was going on then (early 2015), I knew the S7 Edge would be an iterative succession, and not a big leap forward. So I bought my S6 Edges with the thought in mind that I would have it for at least 2-3 years. My analysis was that Samsung at that point in time had plateaued their curved screen technology and philosophy, and would move on next to foldable screens by 2020. I gave them a couple of buffer years in case they didn't feel like introducing us to such drastic technology too early, as Samsung has a habit of forward thinking, yet holding back a year or two so they can milk the most money out of their current technologies. Fast forward to this year, and I have not been wrong - Samsung has indeed matured and plateaued its curved screen plans, but their foldable screen technology has not been up to speed, so it would be delayed for another year or two (they are still on track for 2020). With the introduction and quick adoption/popularity of HDR technology, they can afford to stay on their curved screen plan for another year or two until they lower the costs of their foldable screen technology down enough for mass production.I loved my S6 Edges, but I got bored of the gold one quickly, and sold it to buy a Rose Gold iPhone 6S last year, while keeping the white S6 Edge. I loved everything about it - mainly the beautiful curved screen design, but even more so, the awesome camera, which was the best for its time, and still holds up today as one of the very best in bright light. If you go through my reviews, 99% of the photos from 2015 on are from my S6 Edge. It is so good I have replaced my travel DSLR with it (I still use my Canon 5D Mark III for my serious projects), and all my Instagram photos are also from my S6 Edge (you can find the link to my IG on my Amazon profile).Sorry for the long intro, but it ties to my review that the camera on the S8 is even better. Do not be fooled by early hands-on articles that the rear camera is the same as the S7 Edge. It is NOT the same. It is a new camera system developed by Sony, and it is a dual-pixel system which takes two photos each time you press the shutter button, and quickly and deftly combines the two to give you an awesome final photo, which contains HDR and selective focus elements/photo modes. It excels in low light conditions, with its f1.7 aperature, and it even exceeds the S7 Edge's camera. It might not compete in fast action with the ridiculous 960 fps Sony camera in its new Xperia X phones, but for everyday use, I feel this is the best phone camera so far. It has electronic image stabilization (EIS), even up to 4K video recording, which is a first for phone cameras. The front (selfie) camera is also vastly improved, but not as good as the 13MP camera of the LG G6.This is a photography geek's review, leading in with the camera, but I know most of you are more concerned with the big beautiful screen, which it is exactly that. The resolution is 2960 x 1440 pixels, or a pixel density of 570 ppi. The technology is Samsung's very own OLED, called sAMOLED. It is the same basic technology that makes the best TV screens in LG's OLED TVs. Samsung's 2017 version is so good, it is apparently the best screen ever. You can read more technical specs from Display Mate:displaymate. com/Galaxy_S8_ShootOut_01.htm (erase the space between the dot com)How Samsung has managed to squeeze all that goodness into a phone this size is quite a technological marvel, and quite a gamble as well. Instead of the 16:9 ratio 95% of the phones out there today have, they have chosen on an 18.5:9 ratio, similar to LG G6's 18:9 ratio, but a little slimmer. So this is Samsung's way of truly trying to stand out from the crowd for this generation (year). Cinema (movie theatre) ratio is 21:9, so there truly is no video/film format that perfectly fits this screen's ratio. So there will be empty spaces around the videos and movies you watch, but the black bezels will help eliminate that disparity - note that all S8's, regardless of what color scheme, have black front bezels. Some of the apps have yet to be updated to this ratio, so some will not resize properly, or will have black bars on certain edges. But there is a resize/full screen option in the S8's settings to get around this for now until the app developers update their apps.This phone is actually more narrow than the S6/S6 Edge. The S8 measures 68.1mm wide by 8.1mm thick by 148.9mm tall, and weighs 155 grams, while the S6 Edge is 70.1 x 7 x 142.1 mm, and weighs 132 g. But as you can see it is a tick thicker, and noticeable taller and heavier. So although the S8 has a total footprint that is larger than the S6 Edge, or is actually easier and more comfortable to hold in one hand. For further comparisons, the iPhone 7 is 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1 mm (138 g), the iPhone 7 Plus is 158.2 x 77.9 x 7.3 mm (188 g), and the LG G6 is 148.9 x 71.9 x 7.9 mm (163 g). So it actually is easier to grasp in the hand than most other phones of similar size, only bested by the (much smaller) iPhone 7 (4.7-inch screen vs. 5.8-inch for the S8).The sound systems are also improved, as the speaker is louder and more clear, and the audio processing is much much better for listening to music with your earphones/headphones. However, it is still a mono speaker, not even stereo-immersive sound, and of course nowhere near as good as HTC's usual dual-speakers. Speaking of earphones, a pair of premium AKG earphones are included, which is the best factory-bundled earphones I have witnessed. It cannot compare to my Velodynes and Sennheisers, but it beats all other cheap generic bundled earphones. That reminds me, you should spend the extra $100 on the extra bundle, which in addition to the included VR headset, also includes a Samsun 256GB microSD card, and a pair of AKG Bluetooth headphones. Each sells for over $100, so you are actually saving a bunch: AKG Bluetooth Headphone Black (Y50BTBLK) Samsung EVO+ 256GB UHS-I microSDXC U3 Memory Card with Adapter (MB-MC256DA/AM).My S6 Edge worked fluidly and flawlessly in the first few month. But even with the top processor of the time, and 3GB of RAM, it slowed down as the memory neared the capacity, especially after the hundreds of photos began to pile up. The camera, once near instantaneous to turn on, now takes about a second. The S8, with its 4GB of RAM and either the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor or Samsung's own Exynos 8895 so far is doing an impeccable job. The Snapdragon 821, and even the 820, is fast enough for 2017, so having the 835 and the Exynos 8895 future-proofs it for another 2-3 years at least, since I feel with each successive processor, we are getting to the point where the hardware requirements for software is plateauing, and you would only need the latest processors for video games which keeps getting better and better and continually needs the fastest processor. I think once we reach 6GB of RAM, any processor beyond the 835/8895 should be fast enough for every day apps of the next 10 years.In totality, this is the first phone since the S6 Edge that I got really excited about, and with the rumored OLED iPhone coming out this year, 2017 should be a great year for fans of both sides to upgrade. If you don't mind the $750+ price, you can't go wrong with the Samsung Galaxy S8. It is an investment that should last a few years, or at least until those foldable screen phones come out...."
"Amazon" "Upon owning the Galaxy S8 for a month, I feel ready to give it a review. This phone is a great choice for any Android (operating system) user. The reason this phone is a great fit for Android users is that it is physically the same size as many competitor phones, but the screen is larger. This means users get the best of both worlds; a phone small enough to fit in the pocket, and a large screen.Review CriteriaWhen reviewing a phone, I consider physical appearance, storage capacity, battery life, and how well the phone does what it is supposed to do. This device is visually appealing. If you have had a previous Galaxy, you may recall the only option for black had a distinct blue tinge to it. The S8 is a true black, and it looks much better than the old option. Samsung has brought back expandable storage, which is one of my favorite features. The phone comes with 64 GB of storage, but the option to add an SD card is important for many users who have a lot of photos and media. The battery life on this phone is great so far. Granted, I have only had the phone a month. One key to making the battery last a long time is adjusting the display settings. When the screen is set to one of the lower resolutions, it still looks crisp, and battery life is extended. The last (and most important) criterion sounds general, but I have yet to be disappointed in how this phone functions. The sound quality for phone calls is much higher quality than on any other phone I have used. In general, every other feature has worked well.Potential ImprovementsThere are, however, a couple things I would change about this Galaxy. First, I’m not sure what the purpose of the “Edge” is on these phones (referring to the curved sides). I would prefer if there was still an option for a flat display. This is simply a personal preference, and many users like the Edge. My second concern, like many other reviewers, is the location of the finger print scanner which is very near the camera. The problem with this location is that users can accidentally touch the camera lens and smudge it. The third, and last concern I have, is Bixby. Samsung devoted a button to this function, just below the volume rocker. This location is inconvenient as the button can get accidentally pressed.ConclusionAll in all, the phone has been a pleasure to use. My concerns are only nitpicky annoyances, and I would recommend this product to anybody who is in the market for a new Android device. If you decide to buy the S8, I hope you will be as satisfied with it as I am."
"Amazon" " Included with the phone (Android 7 installed) are the instructions, a type C charging cable, wall adaptor, a Type C/micro USB adaptor, a Type C USB adaptor, and a set of wired headphones with microphone.I have been using the Galaxy series since the S4 with my most recent phone being the S6 (64GB version) and although I have had my complaints about each version, I have been mostly satisfied with the Galaxy phones.  After Samsung recently has a bogo deal, I couldn’t pass up trading in my S6 for the S8’s.The S8 has definitely come a long way in terms of design from the cheap plastic backing that chipped on the S4.  The S8 is similar to the one body design S6 edge with its rounded edge screen, although slightly slimmer and longer which is a bit easier to hold onto even with a case on it than the wider S6.One of the issues I had with the S6 is non-removable battery and that has not changed here as that seems to be the trend for most phones these days but at least the S8 is water resistant as a benefit from the design.  With the exception of this bogo Samsung deal, I tend to keep a phone longer than two years, so I still don’t like the fact that I am limited to the cycle of charges on the battery.  I personally try to extend the battery life by only charging the phone when less than 10 percent instead of plugging in just at any time.One of biggest complaints I had about the S6 was the lack of an external card slot and I am happy that Samsung brought back the memory card slot (capable of a 256GB card) with the S8.  It will hard to run out of space on this phone for sure.My biggest issue in design with the S8 is not with the missing home button (which so far, I haven’t missed), has been replaced by an onscreen one but instead is with the odd location of the fingerprint sensor.  One of my favorite features from my S6 was the ability to use your fingerprint instead of a password to unlock my phone or open certain apps.  It is a great time saver to me.  Oddly though, Samsung puts the sensor on the phone right next to the camera lens.  It makes it difficult to locate and you have a tendency to smudge your camera lens with your fingers.  Add a case (such as the Otterbox I have) and the fingerprint read becomes a bit less accurate.  Maybe with current technology, Samsung just couldn’t squeeze it into another location but I do think they could have thought that out a bit better.  Maybe my irritation with this will fade with some practice but I think I prefer a front facing sensor on the next phone (hint, hint!! Samsung).Samsung does add an Iris and faceprint method of opening the phone but I really don’t find this as accurate or as practical to do as the fingerprint sensor.Since my S6 used the latest Android OS, there are really any major differences in features that the S8 has.  There are a few additions that my S6 didn’t have, such as the edge feature and some odd additions too, such as Samsung adding Bixby, which to me is just another version of Google assistant.  Bixby still seems to be in development though and doesn’t always work as intended.  It does have its uses though at least but Samsung does add several of its own apps as well that I didn’t personally find beneficial but may or may not be useful to you.  One slight change from my S6 is the method of opening the all apps section.  Instead of a small icon, you swipe up to open the apps listing.There are a couple additional OS security updates that the phone has when you initially start up the phone, which does take a couple of reboots and installs to do, at least on the Verizon network anyways.The curved phone screen looks great and has a sharp, beautiful high resolution screen.  The phone is also very quick with the apps and runs more smoothly than the older S6.  Even though the phone uses a harder Gorilla Glass, a good quality case is essential to protect the curved edges.  One downside I have found of the curved edge is that most screen protectors tend to hurt the sensitivity of the phone’s edge features.  I use a wallet case instead of an open face case with a screen protector for that very reason.Battery life is better than the S6 with a bit larger battery.  I usually go up to 2 days on a charge, depending on what I am using it for.The camera photo quality is good but only has one lens instead of two.  I am big phone picture person so that isn’t a huge thing for me though.Of course, with going to the S8 means all those micro cables you have are pretty useless since the S8 now uses the Type C standard cable.  At least Samsung provides one adaptor for the old cables, making it less painful but it would have been nice if a second one could have been provided so that you could have a charging option for the most common charging areas (home, car, office).The phone is expensive (what one isn’t these days) but if you can catch a deal like Samsung’s recent bogo one, then this is a great phone to get.Other than the glaring bad location for the fingerprint sensor, this is a sharp looking and well-designed phone.4 stars"
"Amazon" "Great overall phone! Battery is sufficient, it's fast, beautiful, has a nice camera. I'd don't care so much for all of Samsung's apps, but most of them are easy to uninstall or disable. The price for such a beautiful phone seems to be that it is slippery and, being wrapped in glass, it feels fragile, also the curved display makes it harder to protect with a case. The fingerprint sensor isn't much of an issue with the smaller S8, especially since the iris scanner works so well."
"Amazon" "Disappointing..Cons:Fingerprint sensor works only some of the time. It will just stop working, then require a reboot to get it working again.Do Not Disturb feature doesn't seem to work, I still receive notifications noises, although it seems to be only when I am connected to WifiLong playing audio apps (such as a white noise maker) will fade in and out sometimes after a few hours, sometimes after a few minutes, and continue to increase frequencyClosing all apps, which a nice feature doesn't really do this, if you're listening to music or a podcast , it doesn't stop the app from playing somehow but still closes the appText messages don't display on lock screenE-mails display on lock screen but only the most recentBixby button is super annoying, I don't want it and I keep accidentally launching it somehow and it takes a few seconds to load so I have to wait to close itWhen I am on speaker, the other person can't hear me at allAlso when speaking to someone on a S7 (both have Verizon) I am told i occasionally sound mechanical and the audio quality ois poor (though I don't have that problem), on my iPhone this wasn't an issueCons can't get tempered glass protection because of the shape of the screen, just a cheap feeling plastic film to put over the screenPros: Cool phone, cool features, great camera, lots of options. I love the fast charging thingFor the record I had a Samsung Continuum back in the day, I loved it, gave two iphones a shot, then went back to Samsung and I am starting to think that was a mistake."
"Amazon" "Unless you protect this phone with a folio style case such as the Otter Strada, avoid at all costs. I had this phone for 3 days with aSpigen case. One 2.5 foot drop from my pocket onto an asphalt surface rendered this phone useless. Both the glass screen and LCD were ruined. Samsung touts this phone wrapped entirely in gorilla glass at practically indestructible. This of course is a gross overreach. There have been hundreds of complaints on Samsung consumer feedback page as well as pages hosted by third party repair shops. Forget about any assistance from Samsung and Verizon unless you have insurance. My local Verizon wireless store flat out lied and said the Galaxie 8 is no more fragile than any other Samsung model. If there is a class action law suit, which there should be, count me in."
"Amazon" "I have been getting old phones for free from Verizon for years, and they don't last 2 years.  I just wanted a new phone and got this one.  It came with in 2 days, and was working at the Verizon store with in 1 hours !!!!  True I like all the bells and whistles, but I really like that it works !"
"Amazon" "This phone may work on Verizon, but it will be degraded as several features such as advanced calling will not be available.  Also, Breed makes you pay to return the phone unlike most other sellers."
"Amazon" "Has anyone else had problems with the S8 (or other Galaxy S phones) dropping some bottom row of letters with fast typing, especially the \"N\" key (for example, when typing \"confirm\" or \"instead\" you get \"co firm\" or \"i stead\").  Have tried resetting keyboard settings. Have tried Settings - Backup and Reset - Reset Settings. Have cleared auto-correct cache, etc.  Have tried both Google and Samsung soft keyboards. Same issue.  About to return S8 to BestBuy to try a new replacement, as I'm on the 14th day of my purchase, but I suspect it's the way the device itself is built or programmed (either software, hardware, or both) and new phone will have the same issue.Curiously, I noticed the same thing start to happen on recently on my previous S5 replacement (not even a refurbished unit, this was a brand new factory-sealed replacement, done by Verizon as a courtesy) right before I got the S8. It is driving me nuts and I can't figure out if it's just my muscle memory, or if some Samsung/Google/Verizon update \"broke\" the sensitivity to the bottom row of the soft keyboard?  I never used to have this problem on either the S5 or S8 until maybe 6 months ago, using it for ~2 years prior...and my hands and typing style have not changed!Anyone else experiencing this???"
"Amazon" "Best phone I have used ever. Previously, I have owned: Apple iPhones 1 through 6s. Android: Nexus 6P, Samsung S6 edge, S7 Edge. The S8 is not only a thing of beauty, the functionality from the touch wiz refinements and feature set over the years have culminated into an amazing experience of usability. The connectivity options are so damned good. I can live without using the Bixby button or service ( still not mature enough to make it indispensable, yet). Haven't had the need to use Nova launcher either. Battery life has been quite good. there must be about 6+ ways to unlock the phone so using the fingerprint scanner on the back is not a problem. In addtion, the location of the fingerprint scanner is overblown, it's not a problem IMO. Gaming speeds are significantly improved over the S7 Edge. Frame rates are decent and no longer a slide show while playing Contest of Champions. iPhone users still gain the upperhand with iMessage and overall smoothness/speed. But pretty much Android and Samsung have beaten the pants off Apple in overall form and function. I purchased direct from Verizon."
"Amazon" "Save yourself, do not buy into the hype.Wrap around screen is brittle/ chip a corner if you look at it wrong.  First pushed upgrade destroys your speaker sound."
"Amazon" "Excellent phone, excellent condition. Thank you!"
"Amazon" "I have had this phone for about a month now and have not had any issues, I absolutely love this phone so far!"
"Amazon" "Over the last few years I've owned the original (Gigantic) Galaxy Note, a Motorola Droid, Nexus 4, LG G3, Galaxy S6 Edge+, GS7 and now the S8+. I had planned on getting the Note 7 instead of the GS7 but I think we all know how that turned out. I came really close to buying the LG V20 but what essentially helped make my decision was wireless charging. No matter how gimmicky you think it is, once you get used to it, you'll not want to give it up, I promise. I wasn't eligible for an upgrade until after the Note 8 is released, but I changed jobs and they gave me a S8+ and I jumped at it.First off, it's not perfect--and I'll go into why I withdrew that last star in a bit. It may be trivial to YOU, but for me, it was enough to not give it a perfect score. Next, lets discuss the first thing you notice: that Infinity Display. I've had several iPhone die hard fans actually look at it in utter jealousy. Its hard not to. Compared to the iPhone 7 Plus with a paltry 5.5\" screen and just 1920 X 1080 resolution vs Full HD Plus (2960 x 1440) is just one of the reasons why this phone beats the dated apple device hands down. The S8 and the S8+ are dramatically different from their predecessors with a completely new aspect ratio which makes the device taller and thinner. With a 6.2\" screen you'll be amazed that they managed to cram that amazing display in a body only slightly taller than the iPhone 7 Plus and definitely narrower and less than a millimeter thicker. The argument that eliminating headphone jack meant giving iPhone users bigger batteries and other nifty goodies is proven categorically to be just hot air since Samsung managed a 3500 mAh battery in the S8+ AND a headphone jack. No matter how old the technology is, say what you want, but it still works better than bluetooth earbuds--at least as I write this. It won't be long before bluetooth will genuinely equal the quality of corded earbuds...but that day is not today.The build is exceptional and very futuristic looking, easily leaving all other designs in the proverbial dust. I can't think of any other device with a screen that is as close to taking up the entire face of a phone as much as the GS8's. I keep hearing that a move to 4K displays are a foregone conclusion and not that anyone will take MY word for it, but I honestly believe that is entirely unnecessary. I would much rather phones keep the current resolution and concentrate more on battery life. Upping the screen resolution only puts more strain on the battery to illuminate all those extra pixels and I promise you, the screen tech is out-pacing battery ability right now. Samsung, leave it alone until you can make 4K at least as good as the battery life on current models with less. The front and back are Gorilla Glass 5 and while it is durable and scratch resistant, it is STILL vulnerable to breaking, even from short drops onto very hard surfaces, so do yourself a favor and buy a GOOD case to protect your investment. After all, its not a question of IF you're going to drop it, but when. Also, that glass on front and back make it a bit on the slippery side, so despite the all premium build, it ISN'T without some flaws built into that really nice exterior.The S8 keeps the IP68 rating of the GS7 and while the speaker can get loud, its rather tinny and won't reproduce music to the degree the iPhone 7 can. If that isn't a priority for you, then don't worry, but if its a big deal, you may consider thinking of something different. I would imagine the IP68 certification has something to do with the quality of the speaker, too. I suppose you need to make some sacrifices--though if I'm being honest, the iPhone has a slightly less rating (IP67) but yet still has great speakers, so its something to consider...but remember the GS8 has a headphone jack while the iPhone doesn't. Trade one for the other I guess.Okay, my gripes. I have two so far. On my GS7 when I hit the home key and then swiped to unlock the phone it was almost instantaneously unlocked. For some reason, once I press the power button (now on the right side of the screen) and then swipe up to unlock the screen, it doesn't work. I have to wait almost a full second before I can actually swipe. Yes, I know, First World Problems...but is it entirely unreasonable to expect a newer device to be at the very least AS fast doing this as the previous model? I don't think so. My other gripe may not be an issue for many of you at all, but I can assure you for me it truly is. One of the many advantages Android has over iOS is customizing. I like several different keyboards and while the stock Samsung keyboard is okay, it is far from what I like--in fact I don't use it at all. I prefer GBoard, Swype and Swiftkey Flow. Before, if I wanted to switch from one keyboard to another while I was texting, as long as the keyboard was visible on the screen, you just swiped down from the top and the option to switch keyboards was right there. For some reason they have left this option off of the S8. For the life of my I cannot figure out why. Again, the ability to easily customize Android has always been a huge selling point for me (and I know many of you) so now making this feature more difficult to access makes no sense and honestly, Samsung, you NEED TO FIX THIS ASAP. It pissed me off enough that I totally docked a star from my review almost entirely because of this one thing. Now, for those of you who rarely or never really change your keyboard, this won't be an issue whatsoever, but I can assure you for me it was an enormous pain in my backside.Going from the S6 to the S7 I noticed virtually no difference in the speed of either model. I was expecting to see a bump in performance when I got the S7 but nope. However, the same cannot be said of the S8. I have noticed a very noticeable bump in performance and battery improvement, even though the S8+ has a slightly smaller battery than the S7 (from 3600 to 3500 mAh). In fact I have noticed a marked battery improvement as well. This is supposedly due to the much smaller and more efficient and faster chipset used. Not sure if that's it, but it certainly was a welcome change of pace. You can squeeze a bit more juice out of your phone by changing the screen brightness and resolution without missing out on much at all. I keep mine at the setting that came stock (which is not the highest resolution out of the box, strangely enough) because I cannot tell a difference. There are also different performance settings for gaming and whatnot that can drastically reduce battery length, so keep that in mind.I tried playing with the Iris scanner and fingerprint reader. My honest belief is this: while its probably important to keep security on your device, I tend to have none. I know, I know, its not wise, but hey, sue me. The Iris scanner though DID seem to work pretty well and rather quick, too. I was impressed with its speed, though it does take a bit of practice to align your eyes with the forward camera before you can truly take advantage of that speed, but it doesn't take long. The placement of the fingerprint scanner was a HUGE debate leading up to the GS8's release. Will it be an issue? That is entirely up to you. The 8+ is a tall device and if you have small or short fingers, yes it'll probably will be. Wherever possible, I recommend you go into a store and hold one in your hand and see for yourself before making the purchase. It could make a world of difference for you. I didn't try using the face unlock feature at all. Androids in years past had it and I just never thought it was very secure (ha, like I care). Keep in mind a sufficiently close photo of you could unlock the phone, too.I've noticed on the always on display that the selection of screens seems to be smaller than the GS7. Not sure if I simply cannot find the other options or whether or not that is just true--but either way, I thought I'd mention it. The basic one that is at launch works fine for me, so no complaints there.Bixby. Honestly, I cannot figure out why they made such a stink about it when they announced the device only to launch it without 95% of its ability to do what they \"claimed\" it would. They even devoted a button exclusively to its use, which is a waste you cannot truly re-map it. Supposedly you could at its launch, but Samsung reportedly forwarded a patch that would make that useless (or so I've heard). The good news is that Google Now DOES come pre-installed and works as brilliant as always. There is a different way to access it, well, slightly different anyway. Before if you long pressed on the home button it'd launch, but now you just press the built-in screen home button and hold it instead. Still works and since I had always thought S-Voice was an embarrassment of a virtual assistant, I have very low expectations for Bixby, which Samsung insists WILL be arriving soon before the end of this year. If I'm wrong I'll be happy to admit it...but somehow I just doubt it. From what I hear though, Bixby was developed by the same people who did Siri for apple, so who knows, maybe it WILL be all Samsung claims it will be. Time will tell. In the meantime Google Now is my friend.I love how the GS8 comes with standard 64 GB of memory and also includes the ability to add more, unlike apple. Great option and I have more memory available after moving all my stuff from my old phone over than my GS7 came with, now that's nice. I have an expansion card, but I doubt I'll need it, but you never know. It's nice to have either way.The cameras are great. Where they truly shine is not only are they great front and back, but both have f1.7 aperture. So they absolutely are stellar at taking low-light photos, yes, even better than the iPhone 7 (if only slightly so). I think bumping up the front camera to 8MP was a smart move. With the popularity of selfies not slowing down, it was a wise precaution. Making it also auto focus like the unbelievably FAST back camera was utter brilliance. It may not have image stabilization like the back, but hey, better is better. The S8 is also the first mobile device certified to play HDR content, which is fancy talk for saying your viewing will be bright & crisp and virtually without equal. Now when iPhone releases their next model, I would expect it to be received as just shy of blessed from On High as the greatest this or that no matter how much of its new bells and whistles first appeared on an Android device...that doesn't mean apple is without ability to innovate (3D touch comes to mind) but I would expect the next version to have a great camera as usual and a few other bells & whistles. It remains to be seen if it'll have the in-screen thumbprint reader as it was also rumored the GS8 would have as well, but they weren't able to perfect it in time, hence the awkward placement of the thumbprint reader on back, or maybe the tech isn't capable at this point to pull it off, I don't know. Maybe the next iPhone will have it, maybe not. We'll find out one way or another soon enough. If they pull it off, good for them. I would expect then to see one on the upcoming Note 8, but nothing is certain.One more thing, the addition of the USB Type C charger was awesome. As frustrating as it is to have to buy all new cords (I have like a bazillion of the Micro USB charging cords all over) I find the new design to be a very welcome one. Let's be honest, we've all gone to plug in one to our phones only to discover that you had it upside down, right? Gosh it was frustrating. Its nice to not have to worry about whether or not its upside down. They also came out with an adapter so you can still use an older Micro USB which was very convenient as well. The continuation of wireless charging and fast charging is always very convenient. I love plugging in my phone after my coworker has started charging their iPhone, and in less time I've topped my phone off and a few have even accused me of making it up--til I proved it. Their reaction: almost always, \"Wow! That's amazing!\" I think the next iPhone will probably (finally) adapt that along with possibly wireless charging. They'd be stupid not to.Is it perfect? No. But its a good improvement over the GS7, enough so that I can happily endorse it to anyone who is looking to impress their die hard apple fanboy friends, or simply to just have a great device all the way around.***UPDATE***I discovered, quite by accident, how to change keyboards--my biggest complaint about the phone--just as simple as the old method. It isn't as obvious as it was before, and to be candid, I still don't know why they changed it so much, but it IS just as simple to change keyboards as it was before. For example, if you are in your messaging app and your current keyboard is displayed, at the bottom of the screen you'll see your usual options, recent, home and back on-screen buttons, but to the far right is an icon that kind of looks like a keyboard. It's not as obvious as I think it should be, but by touching that icon you'll get a drop-down menu to change your keyboard. Again, its quick, simple if not obvious. It works and works well, I just wish Samsung had made that feature a bit more easier to figure out. With that feature now available, I bump my rating to a full 4.5 stars. My apologies for not noticing it earlier."
"Amazon" "Terrible phone, at least the one I got had very bad performance.I bought it like 4 weeks ago and already want to go back to my old phone. The index of the contact list isn't accurate, I pick \"M\" and even if I have contacts with that letter on their lastname I end up around \"K-L\"... it's the same for every letter I choose.The performance isn't good. Youtube gets bugged everytime, so I end up seeing a gliched screen, or I keep listening to the audio but the video get stuck.Besides all that, the phone itself is waay too fragile. The screen unglued because the adhesive wasn't good enough.Edit: The smartphone is brick-dead in less than 5 months. Don't buy it.Buy other phone if you're looking for one. This isn't worth it."

I use my index finger to scan and it feel more natural to me.The camera is very very very good. I do not have any negative issue about this phone. A very awesome product."

"Amazon" "Was scared to buy such an expensive phone through Amazon, but it arrived in the original box without out a scratch. Was also worried about being international, but still no problems so far. I bought one from best buy with a Snapdragon chip. Amazons s8plus came with Samsung's Exynos chip, which is a tiny bit faster. But i heard that Samsung turned the Snapdragon down a bit. Works great."
