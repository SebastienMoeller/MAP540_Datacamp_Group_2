1,Amazon,Samsung S8,"BEWARE!99% of the negative reviews are SELLER REVIEWS! People bought used products or from a private seller and got something not covered by amazon. BUY NEW, FROM AMAZON. If you don't know how to shop, I suggest you double check where the item is coming from in your cart and before you check out. PAY ATTENTION!After owning the phone long enough to be familiar with it, I thought I would leave a decent review outlining some of the pro's and con's, as well as some neutral's. My review is as follows: (see end comments about unlocked and verizon use - this phone is 100% unlocked!)Pro's:1. Very sleek design. Very nice screen and overall a great phone.2. The camera/video recorder is AMAZING. Simple as that. I took amazing outdoor and indoor (even in low light/no light) pictures. I am genuinely impressed and was not expecting it to be so good. (See last pic. Photo on phone was taken by s8)3. The pixel ratio/screen size. I got the s8 because I did not want a huge computer in my pocket, and it has plenty of room in it.4. Very fast. The processor even with battery settings set to a mid level (which can be changed to your personal preference) is still fast enough to do anything you can throw at it.5. RAM and Storage ration. Perfect. Plenty of ram to handle multi-tasking and plenty of storage to handle those 4k videos/pictures PLUS room to expand with SD storage, which is also getting much better and bigger. But 64GB entry level... eat your heart out apple.6. Great speaker! I mean wow... this thing get's loud. I was also not expecting such great sound. You will have no trouble hearing anything even in a loud environment. Seriously amazed here.7. Power saving/Battery life. Simply put, the AMOLED allows for some amazing battery life and the 3000mah batter holds up well. Very well. Much better than the iPhone.8. Fast charging. The lowest I have had the battery is about 60% and it charged in under an hour.9. AMOLED screen. As stated in #7, it helps with battery life but other than that, it has plenty of brightness and picture clarity. I also carified in #3 that the screen size and pixel ratio were simply stunning. You will notice this if you game alot or during those 4k picture zooms and probably much more on the s8+.10. Accessories and headphone jack. It has a headphone jack! lol. The accessories that came with the phone are great. A fast charging cable, a type-c to mini usb extension, and a usb to type-c extension as well. The headphones are simply amazing too. By far some of the best I have owned, as far as ear buds go, and you don't have to pay for good quality here. The material of them is great and they come with extra different size earbuds.11. Water resistance. While I have not tested it, and probably never will, it's a great feature. I still don't recommend dunking your phone.12. Pocket settings. There is an option to keep the screen off while in your pocket, or something like a purse. Simple as that. If you butt dial, you probably are not navigating the settings well enough. Keep in mind, android has A LOT of settings, and it would be wise to go through them all including the basic options that samsung offers.13. Widget size. You can actually adjust the size of every single widget, and fit more apps on the pages as well as the default home row. You can also change the lock screen apps, if you want any at all. I personally have a camera and the phone app on the lock screen, and keep all my apps on a single page, in folders, the weather, a google search bar with the mic button, and lastly a control panel for quick access to bluetooth and auto-sync buttons etc etc.. All on one page, with plenty of empty space. Half the screen is even still empty. Thank you so much for resizeable widgets.Neutral:1. Bixby button. The button is below the volume buttons, so nothing you can do there. However, you can disable bixby. Most reviews on here are failing to realize this and also failing to outline how. See the end of my review for simple instructions.2. Phone Length. I'll admit, it's pretty long. Maybe I am just to used to an older, smaller phone, but one handed operations is going to take some getting used to. Be mindful of the edges of the screen too. Too much palm and you will be scrolling. I do not see this as a negative still, just takes some getting used to and as outlined in the pro's section, the overall screen size is perfect.3. Edge lighting. A bit torn on this one. It seems cool, but is pretty much useless. It's basically a notification before the notification. So you would have to tap twice and then unlock as well. IMHO, it does look really cool, but SAMSUNG needs to give us more control over it.4. Always on display. This can also be turned off. I find it 100% useless, but not a negative by any means. I feel it can definitely cater to some users who enjoy always being able to look at their phone. I personally disabled it and honestly looked no further into it.5. Color settings. I have always disliked samsung's default colors. Especially on TV's. However, there is an option to change them to your liking. I chose the basic setting, but there is even an option to change balance which let's you arrange a set of liked color boxes, whites, and blacks to your liking and all kinds of other options for personal preference. It really is a great setting, however, it is a neutral and not a pro simply because they enable a very rich color by default. So I recommend changing this to suite your own eyeballs.6. The lock screen clock/theme settings. In order to change the lock screen clock, you have to register with samsung themes and install a theme, which can be somewhat custom. I did this, and the deactivated my account. The setting were retained and all is well. Still a neutral because I feel samsung should incorporate a way to change the lock screen clock by default to a couple preset clocks. The standard one IMHO, is ugly and not aesthetically pleasing to read.Con's:1. Typical android settings. Everything is always on. This is not a samsung issue, but android. I recommend going through every single option, and every single app to change every single setting. Sometimes, this can take the first week of owning an android phone to get right. This also almost always has a HUGE impact on battery life. There are settings in sub-menu's of settings. So please, NAVIGATE YOUR ANDROID SETTINGS! Your poor battery life is not due to this phone at all. It is due to negligence and laziness.2. ""Ok Google"". This seems to always be on, even when turned off in googles settings. I have a search bar and I have turned off all settings both in the phone and google, but for some reason if you say those two naughty words, it still comes up. However, if you do not set it up, it will only be asking you to set it up. Same thing as bixby almost, but this is a negative because I do not want my mic on. At all. I think samsung needs to address this before anything else, even the bixby issues some people are not liking or failing to change.3. All glass. The phone is not strong by any means. It does not feel like a cheap POS, but it is all glass. This belongs in the negative because most of us are drop prone, and even if you are not, it is very easy to make a mistake. Overall, it looks amazing, but there is no need for a glass backing too. I highly recommend you get a case, and if you are in fact drop prone, get a big durable case like an otterbox with a screen protector. The risk will always be there with all smart phones, but the s8 being all glass just seems pointless. That said, I have NEVER dropped a phone to a point where it broke (fingers crossed, knock on wood).4. The finger print scanner. What a stupid placement for a finger print scanner. Right next to the camera lense? come on... I personally do not use it at all, but if I did and wanted to take a picture, you would be cleaning your lense as soon as you unlocked it. Nobody wants to take an unclear photo because they used the finger print security feature. I like the Google Plus one, but feel that if any, Apple has the best one being in the home button.On a side note: THIS PHONE IS UNLOCKED. It can be used with ANY carrier. If you do not pay attention to who or where you buy it from, at least leave a sellers review instead of a product review. 99% of the negative reviews are this. Please pay attention and buy a new phone from Amazon only. I do not ever recommend getting a refurb on this kind of product, or buying from a private seller regardless of their rating. You just never know.As for Bixby, all you have to do is not set it up and hold the home screen like you are adding a widget, scroll to the left and hit the button to turn it off. This will not remove it, but will stop it from doind whatever crazy stuff these other reviews are talking about. I have had NO ISSUES with bixby, because I turned it off. Also, make sure you go through your settings, including the subsettings imbedded into android like background data usage etc etc and turn it all off. People having battery issues, I guarantee it is not the s8's fault. It is android and you would not get any better life with iOS for failing to go through your settings. GO THROUGH YOUR SETTINGS! every. single. one. Over and over for a week until you find every nook and cranny. There is a lot!Overall, this phone is amazing. The list of pro's, con's, and neutral's are simply my take and my opinion. I do recommend the phone. At least if you are in a position to think about it and can try it, go to a local store and pick one up on the display to play with it, but it's just not the same as owning it. I was torn between a google pixel xl and this one, but when this dropped in price it made my decision that much easier. I did like the idea of a bigger phone, however, I just kept thinking how big it would be in my pocket. So I went with the standard s8 and I am very happy I did. I do a lot of fishing, hiking, and outdoor stuff and 90% of the time, I TRY to keep my phone around me in my pocket in case of an emergency. Usually off, because where I go there is no signal anyways.Any review stating a mostly negative opinion, in my opinion, is probably a bit trollish or did not do any research and made an impulse buy. I think you can get used to this phone and if you are complaining about the things I have outlined here, the only one to blame is you. So give it a try, navigate ALL the settings, get used to android, and don't drop this phone lol! Thank you for reading.",5.0
2,Amazon,Samsung S8, So far the best phone I ever had. Man it's beautiful. Sleek design and powerful hardware. I did a comparison with my old phone and you certainly can feel that it's more powerful. I'm not used to it yet. But it does everything perfectly. The picture quality is superb. I love shooting video and it nails it in video quality and it does slow motion!! say whaaaat!! But sometimes it overheats under the direct sun when I record video but I think that is normal. I don't use the fingerprint sensor only because I can't find it. And the mono speaker under the phone is a downside which most of the time I cover it with my little finger and it's kinda annoying. Other than that it's freaking fast and top notch phone. I don't regret buying it .Make sure to check out the video and pictures and if my review was helpful please press YES for helpful. Thank you,5.0
3,Amazon,Samsung S8,"I was skeptical about buying this phone off Amazon instead of Verizon because the reviews were half good, half bad as far as activating it on the Verizon network.  My advice is dont go to the store and activate yourself on their website.  It takes just 5-10 minutes.  Just make sure to have a Verizon nano SIM card, I was able to use the one from my iphone 6.  Transfer your contacts, music etc on their app as well, it's very easy.  Other than that the actual phone is great.  Very sleek looking phone.  This phone is $756 at Verizon and they try to sell their payment plan to you but I would much rather pay the cheaper Amazon price and keep my phone bill lower.  If you're on the fence like I was I hope this review can help you out.",5.0
4,Amazon,Samsung S8,"This phone should be a no-brainer. Easily the most stunning display ever on a phone, great specs, Samsung Pay, expandable storage, and waterproofing SHOULD make this the best phone on the market. Enter Samsung's software. While Touchwiz isn't nearly the raging dumpster fire it was back in the S4 and S5 days, there's still a lot of extras that most will consider junk. Chief among these is Bixby. Have you ever wondered what Siri would be like if it were dumber and had a dedicated hardware button? That's Bixby. Not content to let Google do the heavy lifting, Samsung's MO continues to be creating inferior versions of services already offered by Big G. Want to remap that button to something actually useful? Too bad. Samsung keeps patching the phone in order to force their bloatware down your throat. As it is, that's a dead button that you'll press once out of curiosity, and a few dozen times while trying to turn down the volume. One other annoyance of note is the horrible placement of the fingerprint scanner. There's just no excuse for this one.Overall, it's a great phone that's held back by Samsung's usual goofball decisions.",3.0
5,Amazon,Samsung S8,"I haven't owned a Galaxy phone since the Galaxy Nexus.I've always felt that Samsung's Touch Wiz UI was too gimmicky and looked cartoon-ish.This is my 5th phone in the last 6 months. I was coming from a Nexus 6P, One Plus 3T, Axon 7 and LG V20.I really liked the LG V20 for it's cameras and the Axon 7 for it's front facing speakers. The 6P and One Plus 3Twere so smooth. But I decided to trade it all in for the S8.I was initially going to get a Google Pixel, but prices were still high and besides the camera, not much appealed to me.The S8 is a damn sexy phone with over 80% of the front being the screen. I like the size. Fits perfectly in my hands.I don't think I will go back to a 6"" phablet phone. The screen is vibrant. The clear flip cover case works well with it too.Touch Wiz has been toned down from what I remember, but there is still a lot of bloatware, which I quickly disabled.I guess I like all the screen shot options this phone has to offer. You take screen shot many ways, annotate, make gifs, etc.Charging is pretty fast and the battery lasts me all day. The included headphones are really good. Can't go wrong with AKG. They look cheap, but they sound superb. I'm using Face Unlock, it's really fast. I have my finger print set up too, but face unlock is faster and more convenient. I guess someone can always hold up a picture right? (Haven't tried it yet) The finger print sensor takes a little bit to get used to. My finger naturally goes to the where the camera is located and you need to fully press on the sensor to get it to unlock.They should move the camera to the corner like some phones.USB-C is awesome.Bluethooth 5 is Awesome. You can now stream to 2 separate bluetooth speakers at the same time (one will have a slight delay though).I have a few gripes.Even though it has a F1.7 aperture the camera is not wide angle. It does take really good pictures and videos.My other gripe is the single speaker. C'mon... it's 2017.... all Flagship phones should have stereo speakers.Get rid of Bixby. Let us just use Google Assist.By default the phone display is set to 2220X1080, which is fine for me. You can always set it to WQHD (2960X1440). I'm not sure how much more battery the phone will be using if you did. I still like that Samsung lets you put a SD card it it and it comes with a OTG adapter so you can plug in other USB sticks too. The Edge panel is just ok. Still getting used to it. I can live without it.This phone has tons of other features too, but I'm not going to list them all. Overall, it's the best smart phone I've ever owned. Hopefully it holds up well over the next 2 years.",4.0
6,Amazon,Samsung S8,"I've been getting Samsung phones since the Galaxy S1. But when I got this phone the Bixby feature was a minor problem. After a month its gotten even more annoying the fact Bixby would come up and whats worse, is we can NOT reprogram or disable that button. Later on I realized there was a lot of other crap-ware Samsung was forcing on us that would popup up as well. The worst was when I wanted to take a video and yours truly Bixby vision came up and I missed the shot. There are other problems but all were minor what bothers me is the amount of small problems. Unless in the next Galaxy Samsung stops forcing crap-ware onto their phones this is the last Samsung phone I would ever get.",1.0
7,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Amazing phone. Just about every thing of this phone is better than the top end of iPhones. Better screen. More memory. Expansion slot. Better form. +Fingerprint sensor. Great iris sensor, and a good face detection. Better software controls because unlike iOS, android gives you a lot of control over so many aspects of user experience.I used to be an iPhone user for many years but finally got bored of the lackluster hardware, and being dictated what I should want from my phone. I use a standard ear phones, and expect my phone to honor my wishes.",5.0
8,Amazon,Samsung S8,"I ordered this on Black Friday and after waiting a few weeks it arrived. I didn't expect to actually enjoy an Android based phone, but I was pleasantly surprised. My carrier fully supports this phone and I consistently get maximum speeds in my city (150/20). At home I get gigabit wifi. It was a little weird to look at the curved sides, but I got used to it after about 2 days. I highly recommend the OtterBox Defender case because this phone, like many others, is a bit too thin for large hands.",5.0
9,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Nice size, getting used to it's function. Just a bit different from my Windows phone, which was very easy to use, just very buggie after the recent OS update. Nice display, quick function, just a bit of a challenge to navigate around the phone. Imbedded apps are a pain, and slow the phone down. Google got it right with their Pixel 2. Aftermarket products are hit-or-miss for the S8, as many cases for this aren't very snug-fitting. READ the reviews for cases and accessories. Some really suck.",4.0
10,Amazon,Samsung S8,"1.- I bought the ""Phone Only"", this Amazon description makes it look or sound like you are buying a phone on a plastic bag or something,  but it comes in a nice box, with AWG (?) headphones, a pair of extra ear plugs, wall charger with USB cable, a USB adapter and a tool to pop up the phones SD/SIM card comparment.2.- A regular USB micro cable will not fit, but it comes with an adapter.It feels really good in my hand, I bought a Zizo Bolt case that comes with a glass protector.(see pics)More to come later , but I'm a Samsung guy, so I know what to expect, but I'll post an update once i get to use it a little bit more.",5.0
11,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Love the phone.  The all glass aspect and some of the reviews alarmed at first but after using it with a good case for minimal coverage but maximum protection it is all good.  The phone has great features and new technology, the screen is wonderful, video’s are a whole new experience, great speaker, good speaker just can’t say enough about this wonderful product.",5.0
12,Amazon,Samsung S8,The phone itself works fine with great colors and reasonably fast. Take excellent pictures and videos and all in all would buy it again. My biggest negative is that for some reason within two weeks of having this phone it crashed and unfortunately I had just taken about 60 pictures that day which never made it to the cloud and I lost them all. Very disappointing.,4.0
13,Amazon,Samsung S8,"I upgraded to this phone from a ZTE Zmax Pro.  This phone is incredible to any phone I have ever had.  It is very fast and reliable.  It's very well build and sturdy.  I had problems with other phones in my area with my carrier and with this phone, I have not experienced any issues with my signal.  Highly recommend.",5.0
14,Amazon,Samsung S8,I am extremely satisfied with this phone. Had no issues activating it with my current Verizon account. Just went to the retailer for a free SIM card and they set everything up. One thing that I wished I had known prior to purchasing this was that with an unlocked phone you will  not have voicemail notifications. This is software that is installed by carriers onto the carrier specific phones. The only way you will know if you have voicemail is to call your mailbox. There are some apps available to download so this really isn't an issue. I just wish I had known about this so I wouldnt have missed some messages.,5.0
15,Amazon,Samsung S8,Works well with armor case.  I applied with case on to get an exact fit.  Bubbles disappeared within 2 days to leave a completely transparent voating..  So far protector has stayed on without issue for nine days.  I like the texture and touch sensitivity is gone.,5.0
16,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Really bad service from Samsung. The phone came with a defect in the front camera. I called them and they told me it will be fixed when the phone updates to the new version. I was back and forward with Samsung since I notice the issue. I noted first when I made my first skype meeting call. Then when my colleges told me about the issue, I started taking selfies, I notice that all the selfies have the same black spot in the same place. Unfortunately, I figured out the issue 36 days after I bout this phone from Amazon. So, I  could not return the phone due to the 30 days return policy.I contacted Samsung, they asked me to update and reset the phone and so a bunch of staff to the camera app. After the 2nd call, They sent me to a Repair Center close to my home. The repair center wanted to charge me $109 dollars. I called Samsung again. This time Samsung told me that because I was under warranty they can fix it for me. They cannot replace phones but just fix them. Samsung told me that they will take 11 days to fix it. I expressed my concern that I bought an expensive phone because the service as my work and my business depend on a reliable phone. I told them that I cannot afford 11 days without communication. So, they told me ""Well you won't be without communication you can buy a ship phone and exchange the sim card until your phone cames back"".So, does not Samsung understand that an unlock cheap phone cost at minimum 120 and it won't be able to multitask as fast I need to do my job and maintain my business?I do not recommend to buy this phone or any Samsung phone if service and reliability is the most important subject for your purchase.",1.0
17,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Got a new SIM card from my carrier and was instantly up and running. Very happy with the phone, face recognition is better than I expected.  Phone is very fast.  Battery life has been awesome.",5.0
18,Amazon,Samsung S8,Love this phone. I was a little unsure about the curved screen at first but it I actually love the look and feel of it now. Upgraded from an s5 and the difference is amazing.,5.0
19,Amazon,Samsung S8,"To be honest, I purchased this phone June 5th and have had nothing but problems with it since I bought it. The biggest problem, the battery and charging problems. Every time I let the phone get to 40% or less battery life, and plug it in, it automatically just shuts down completely. Not sleep, not screen off, SHUT DOWN. It has been crazy annoying but i dealt with it since it is the ""best phone out there"".Next, the always on screen. Sometimes it is literally ALWAYS ON. screen is on, at the main home screen, not the lock screen. Anyone can get into the phone, browse away and make calls if I a not watching. Also, in this state, if it isn't charging and I put it in my pocket, it actually heats my leg uncomfortably. The only solution is to hit the power button to put it to the lock screen. Very frustrating but I dealt with it because it is ""the best phone out there"".Now this morning i awoke to find the phone powered off. I assume the battery had dies so I plugged it in. Normally, as soon as it is plugged in you would see a circle with a lightning bolt inside that appears, letting you know it is at zero percent but it is charging. The LED light would also blink at the top....nothing. No LED light, no circle with lightning bolt, nothing. I then proceeded to spend 3 hours looking on the internet, calling Samsung, everything to try and rectify the issue. It just will not turn on.So now I get on the phone with Samsung and they have me go through 20 minutes of attempts to resolve the issue, the same things I just spent 3 hours trying. Still nothing. I also read in their warranty for cell phones (see attached screenshot) that ""During the applicable warranty period, provided the Product is returned in accordance with the terms of this Standard Limited Warranty, Samsung will repair or replace the Product, at Samsung’s sole option, without charge."" So i figured they would just ask the woman to overnight a replacement of this 5 month old phone and I would ship this broken one back, done....nope. The woman on the phone refused to even acknowledge replacing was an option even though I read her word for word what the warranty stated. The only option was to send it to them, wait for them to fix it, and then send it back. All of which will take 2 weeks! I replacement can be shipped in 2 days!. I asked her nicely again to replace it as I cannot be without a phone for 2 weeks, no; she wouldn't even consider it since she didn't believe it was in the warranty in the first place. After a 3rd try to get her to understand she simply got quiet as she refused to even discuss it with me any longer. Very disrespectful and lack of understanding of my situation or their warranty apparently  but also very disrespectful to a customer who has spent a fortune on Samsung products.So now I am sending the phone back to Samsung to let them spend 2 weeks to repair and send it back. In the interim I plan to buy another phone THAT WILL NOT BE SAMSUNG. I have been a Samsung fan for 4 years now and have spent close to $20,000 on phones, TVs, all new kitchen appliances. To be so mistreated after all of this loyalty is unbelievable. After tolerating all of nuisances with this phone and then to be told they cannot replace it but it must be sent in for repair for 2 weeks is just unacceptable. This is the reason why Samsung has peaked for me and will now be going downhill. As far I am concerned there will never be another Samsung product in my home and I will actively tell whoever will listen to stay away from this company who does not respect their customers loyalty.Unless this company makes this right I will get the phone back ,sell it and never even consider another Samsung product, period. The aggravation alone is worth 10 of these phones that cost Samsung less than 300 dollars to manufacturer. Losing a 20k customer is going to hurt. Further I plan to post this review anywhere I can so that as many people considering Samsung products understand the company and lack of customer focus.",1.0
20,Amazon,Samsung S8,"KNOWN ISSUES WITH TEXTING - read the Samsung forums before buying this phone. I sent my 2 month old phone in for repair when it stopped sending texts after a security update, and it was supposedly repaired but is still not working! Tech support and Sales pointed fingers at one another and have given me the runaround and refused a refund. Hard to believe Samsung hasn't improved their customer support after the S7 debacle. So far I've wasted hundreds of dollars on a paperweight and hours of my time on the phone with Samsung. Buy a reliable but inexpensive Moto G5 plus instead if you require texting capabilities on your phone!",1.0
21,Amazon,Samsung S8,"The features are alright, but nothing amazing. The Bixby button is just in the way and almost wholly useless. No screen protectors will stay on the damn thing and my screen was broken within 3 weeks because my kid leaned on the sofa and it slid onto my floor. My carpeted floor. This was a phone in an Otterbox case with a screen protector on (I believe it was the 3rd I'd purchased in just as many weeks since they don't stay on.). I took it in since I paid for insurance and they wanted to charge me my firstborn to give me a refurb phone. I decided to call around and it's about $500 for a replacement screen.I'm not particularly hard on phones and always keep them in a case and with a protector because I don't like having to replace overpriced gadgets. The only time I've had a cracked screen in all my years of phone ownership was when the entire strap broke on my bag and my Note 4 wound up with a cracked corner from like 3 tons of books falling on it on a subway platform. If I had any idea that the entire screen would be spider veined from sliding off the front of my sofa onto carpet, there's NO way I'd have bought this. I'm not a fan of the curved edges at all and wish they had a flat version because I really do like Samsung products for the most part. This one, however, is just a dud. It's way too fragile (and repairs WAY too expensive) to be useful to everyday folks. I've gone back to my old phone for now because I can't afford to pay to have it fixed in a repair shop and even the $200 deductible on the insurance policy just isn't worth it for a device that will likely break again if falling 2 ft onto carpet is enough to send it to the ER.",1.0

Just going in and out of my pocket the phone shows a multitude of scratch marks running up both edges of the face and randomly across the front.  All I can say is that gorilla glass 5 is definitely not where it's at.  If the screen didn't scratch so easily I would definitely recommend this phone but because of it I would definitely wait for something else.,1.0

49,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Don't get me wrong, the functionality of this phone is incredible. However, the phone might as well come with a broken screen. This is the first phone that I have ever broken. And within 3 months of owning it, I have broken the screen twice. Both times were low impact falls from heights of about 2 feet while sitting. Furthermore, it breaks through a case, which is even more baffling.The phone is absolutely beautiful out of the box but once it inevitably breaks, you're left with an item that you just paid $400 - $800 feeling like you're trying to wait out a contract until your next upgrade is available. It would be nice to just fix the screen that Samsung should honestly feel ashamed about but that costs $150 - $200 unless you do it yourself. And then you are right back at square one with a new fragile screen not suitable for a device that is considered ""mobile.""I plan on coughing up the deductible to file an insurance claim on the phone. Mostly because the second break occurred in a way that a shard of glass is now impressing the screen preventing me from escaping a black screen while on a phone call. It otherwise works but I cannot look at texts/internet or even hang-up while taking a call.I would strongly advise against buying this phone. Even though I enjoyed my 3 months of use, I wish I had not bought it. Its pretty disappointing that Samsung is not remedying the fagility of this phone in mass. It's comical that a purchaser needs to constantly worry about a $200 bill while using this phone in a fairly standard way. The iPhone X is also a frightening phone since it looks like the same design. I would be exceedingly hesitant to buy anything that even remotely resembles this design in the future.",1.0

84,Amazon,Samsung S8," The video is a three (3.5) month review review of the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus smartphone. We take a look at the design, screen, Touch Wiz, OS, camera, video and audio playback and more. I've been using this as my daily driver and did my best to share my experience.The short version, if you don't want to watch the entire video - love it. One of the best looking phones out there with an awesome screen, camera, and overall performance. Plus it's water resistant and has tons of features.",5.0
85,Amazon,Samsung S8,The camera is great but the phone itself....negative.  The glass on this phone is very fragile.  Even in a case this phone is fragile. Most cases cannot protect the infinity screen.  Visit Samungs website and go to the community forum and look for broken screens.  I wish I had before my purchase.  I shattered the back and it is costing me $70 to repair.  And of course if there is physical damage it voids the warranty.  So use super thin glass and then sit back and collect the repair money. I guess they had to make up for the Note 7 somehow.,1.0
86,Amazon,Samsung S8,"I have been using Samsung phones for 10 yrs.They have made advancements with the S8+, which I truly enjoy however there are too many draw backs for me.The bixby feature is awesome, it took a while to really get use out of bixby for me. You really have to use it in order for it to learn and be useful. I recommend setting it up and going through the prompts, play with it for an hour or two. Set up short cuts. I found that ""take me home"" phrase I used when asking the previous assistant Galaxy to navigate home, does not work on bixby unless you set up a short cut. I do not however like the button. I find myself accidentally hitting the button all the time which disrupts what I'm doing on my phone because then you must wait for the bixby home page to load before you may close out.Two major complaints:The battery. I was blown away by the battery life when I first got my S8+! I've read a lot about battery preservation so I do not charge my phone while I'm sleeping because leaving it on the charger when it's fully charged kills the battery longevity. So I charge a couple hours a day while I'm at work and that's it. I stream music in the car so I expected that to drain the battery quickly but it did not! After exactly 6 months of use, my phone now loses about 30/40% just sitting idle while I don't use it in just about 3 hours. When I noticed this draining battery issue I immediately took action. I deleted every app that I don't use on a weekly basis. I set up the power saving mode. I changed screen settings. It has helped a little bit but not enough to really make a difference. I now have to charge my phone constantly.Because of the very iPhone-esk style they took begining with the S7, the phone now has a glass back that is not removable. Making the purchase of a new battery to fix said problem impossible. I've always liked samsungs products..but this was a poor decision for their consumers.The screen. While the screen is beautiful and ""unboxed""...it is 10x more fragile than any other Samsung or Galaxy I have owned. I cracked my screen within two weeks of ourchase. I was and still am, unable to find a tempered glass screen protector with a fully adhesive screen (because of the new design with the edge). I have sworn by tempered glass screen protectors in the past, they have saved me so many times. I was also unable to find one for the S7 as well. I did purchase one that only adhered on the edges, which did exactly what I thought it would.  It slid off the couch onto carpet and the screen popped right off the phone. Which for the record does nothing to absorb shock and prevent damage. I have the OtterBox symmetry case on my phone and it still cracked when dropped. Right on the stupid edge of the screen where it curves. Then a few months later, it slides off a shelf in the restroom and lands on tile flooring. Shatters again. I have shattered 3 out of the 4 corners on my screen all while in a case. I'd hate to see what happens when it's not in a case.Overall I am disappointed with this new screen, while it is beautiful and excellent for my photography hobby...it just isn't durable or practical. While the new technology advancements Android has made are excellent, I absolutely hate the quality of the phone. It's literally an $800 glass box around a computer.",3.0
87,Amazon,Samsung S8,"I am a long time Galaxy user.  My whole family and I have had Samsung Galaxies since the S3.  But this S8 annoys me to no end.  They are turning the Galaxy into an iPhone.  If I wanted form over function, silly proprietary annoyances just for the sake of an advertising image -- well, I would have bought an iPhone.  But I didn't.Battery:  I have had this S8 for 9 weeks now.  I cannot make it through the day without the phone dying.  That's bad enough.  But far, far worse is the fact that the battery cannot be changed. Lack of interchangeable batteries has long been the Achilles heel of iPhones.  iPhone users constantly complain about it.  So what does Samsung do?  Make a new model with a sealed, non-changeable battery.  So I guess we're supposed to just throw our $750 phone away once the battery goes bad. If all the other Galaxies has interchangeable batteries, and all us users loved it, why would you even consider removing that much-loved feature?  And don't tell me for waterproofing.  I don't care.  You should be able to figure that out.All-Glass Case:  Are you kidding me?  If you look at the phone wrong, it will break.  And it's unbelievably slippery.  Nice combination -- slippery, made of breakable glass, front and back.  People are breaking their phones between the time they get it at the T-Mobile store and the time Amazon Prime can deliver a protective case. And even with a case, it'll break. I mean come on, the whole thing is made of glass.  Of course it's going to break.Proprietary charging port:  The Galaxy S5 had a USB 3.0.  That was genius, seriously.  The S5 was universally compatible -- including backwards compatible with USB 2.0, which means practically every charging cable in the world could be used to charge it.  In addition, USB 3.0 is super fast for data transfers.  So, what does Samsung do?  Create a new, proprietary cable connection that doesn't exist anywhere else on any piece of technology ever invented.  What a great idea -- let's turn the best charging system into the worst.  And that's even worse than Apple.  iPhones are known for their unusable proprietary features, but at least there are lots of different iPhones that use their proprietary cable.  In this case, only the S8 uses this useless connection.Infinity Display:  Samsung touts the ""uninterrupted surface that flows seamlessly over the edges"".  Okay, one question.  Did anyone actually hold this phone in their hand before bringing it to market?  Because if they had, they would know that your hand cannot hold the phone without touching the ""seamless edges."" Obviously.  So, various parts of your hand are constantly interfering with the function of the phone. So, just holding the phone, my hand is constantly fighting with my fingers for control of the phone.  I'd like to know -- who was asking for their phone to be turned into an infinity pool?  In case someone from Samsung is reading this, let me answer the rhetorical question: NO ONE.  No one cares that their phone wraps around the edge if it interferes with the operation of the phone.In other words -- form over function.  Give me a phone that works well over some gimmicky new change that no one cares about anyway.  Stop copying Apple, and bring back a real Samsung Galaxy.",1.0

92,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Are you on ios and wondering how difficult jumping ship to the android flagship phones would be?  Well, that is exactly what I did and here is my experience.I'm starting with my Conclusion because this is long: I love the hardware aspect of the Galaxy S8+ with very few exceptions. It's a beautiful phone. After a couple of weeks I have my phone useable with fairly similar apps and functions I used on iPhone. I like quite a bit of the additional functionality and customization offered. However, using the phone is like having every developer trying to turn the phone into a personal billboard trying to sell me something unless I'm willing to shell out $2 to $3 per app in most cases. To gain some of the higher end customization without ads can cost $5 or more in many cases.  It is quite a bit less efficient in every day use due to lack of streamlined integration between apps and additional ads.ABOUT MEI have pretty much used ios for all my smartphone and tablet needs for about 8 years (or whenever iPhone 3gs came out - I'm 99% sure it was before 2010).  I tested an android tablet for about 5 years ago and I was not impressed with the weight of the device nor the android apps so I stayed with ios.  I'm pretty sure after that experience is when I purchased my first iPad.  About a month ago I had a water incident with my iphone 6 plus and had to decide what phone to upgrade to.My motivation is because there are so many exciting phones in the near future, the Samsung reviews are extremely positive, and the Samsung S8+ is so much cheaper than the iphone 7+ after just months of being on the market (and I don't think this trend will change anytime soon). I jumped ship from ios so I could make a better decision about the next iPhone before its release (iPhone 8+ or whatever they name it).  I've used the Samsung Galaxy Plus phone exclusively for about 3 weeks. Here is what I struggled with, my suggestions for non-android users, what I've learned about android ecosystem, the pros and cons post switching, and what I will likely choose next.PHONE DESIGNBig Pro - This phone design makes people drool. It looks great and it feel great in the hand - especially when you compare the plus size versions.  I could have gone with the plain size of this phone and been absolutely happy. My eyesight isn't that great so the larger screen is great.Pro - The size of the phone is great in the hand.  The smaller one is even better. It feels better than iPhone Plus in the pocket, however the height is about the same so short pockets still cause issues.Pro - Build quality seems top of the line. Buttons work great, etc.Pro - I like the color options better than other phones out there.Meh - Expected to be a fingerprint magnet - and it is. LOLCon - The hard to reach finger scanner on back - I type the unlock code OFTEN due to placement.Con - Dedicated Bixby button - this button is just in the way; its placement causes accidental Bixby engagement all the time and Samsung has locked users out of reassigning the button.PERFORMANCE/BATTERYPro/Meh - In terms of speed the OS (Android Nougat I believe) on this device has come quite a long way. Overall I found the OS response almost on par with ios.  I understand the difference between open architecture and Apple's closed architecture, so this is a great achievement but it doesn't outperform ios in my use so I can't mark it as a clear Pro. It felt capable in every way. It didn't glitch in a way that I didn't find acceptable but ios still wins here.Pro - The ability to change performance modes is nice for increasing battery life or performance. I don't play any high performance games, but the gaming folder options to set the phone as a priority for gaming (no interruptions and high performance) may be the reason for some users to choose this over iPhone.Pro - Quick charging and wireless charging are nice to have available (although I dont have those set up in my house).Meh - With the customization of this phone, it is easy to affect battery life without realizing it. In real day to day useage, I don't have all my charging stations set up for this phones usb c connector - I have iPhone chargers set up in many rooms of my house out of necessity. With most of the usb chargers I have, I dont feel this phone charges much faster than my iPhone. In my experience so far the phone underestimates how long it will take to get to a full charge by quite a bit maybe 20 or 30 percent. The good part is that I don't think it will be any worse than using my iPhone - but I'm not charging this thing any less either.DURABILITYBig Pro - Waterproof. Since my last phone died due water and I was always putting my phone in a ziplock bag to run when weather was questionable or out at the lake, this is something I am glad to have.Meh - Screen glass is marketed to be pretty scratchproof. I've ordered a screen protector and I tried to keep the film on the glass while waiting for it to arrive, but the film didnt stay adhered but 4 days or so.  I've been careful and only carry the phone in my pocket by itself and I have a scratch. I've never scratched a phones screen this quickly but there are so many factors that I won't list it as a con.Meh - I cant speak to back durability personally since I was able to find protector quickly and have not dropped the phone. But videos online show that the back can crack if dropped on concrete from only 3 feet which is about waist height. Although other drop tests show it surviving drops from 5 feet, most crack the backglass at this height. Drop tests online seem to indicate decent front durability often surviving a 5 foot drop. From what I've researched, the front seems as durable as (if not a bit more than) an iPhone and the back really dictates a cover.SCREENPro - The screen resolution is great. I do like the screen, but in use at mid arms length away I can't tell much difference with the resolution at max or the mid setting. I appreciate the ability to run mine at the mid setting to save battery life.Big Pro - I stream movies on my phone often and getting a larger video with a more narrow phone is a GREAT experience.Pro - The curved glass is just sexy on electronics. The screens edge does a great job of ignoring touches when holding the phone. That edge is visible when the phone is face down so it can be set for notifications and I've seen the ability to run a stock ticker down it.Pro - Always on display with very little battery impact. I didn't realize how often I turn on my phone just to see the time or even date. Once this is set to disply the things you are 'just checking,' you will save some battery life.Con - The screen seems VERY dim in comparison to iPhone. It is capable of a comfortable brightness, but when maxed out I feel like I'm using a reduced setting from my iPhone.CAMERAPro - That damn camera bump is gone!!! This phone will sit flat on the table - nuff said if you are using an iPhone.Pro - The cameras (hardware) on this phone are best in class.  I give this phone the edge because in low light, it captures more light than any Apple phone.  In bright light, it's a draw unless you truly have need of the 2 cameras on the iphone.  In my use, my cropped images come out great so a 2nd lens doesn't add the same value as low light performance.  My video needs are the same - I need more low light performance than ability to use a different lens.MEH - I'm not labeling this a con on purpose.  I know there is a phone out there with 2 backfacing lenses. 2 lenses do not make me want that bump on the back of my phone.STORAGEPro - You get a respectable 64 Gig onboard and can add a card (whenever you need it) to increase it at a reasonable price using standard 3rd party memory cards.  None of that bulls**t Apple gouging.PORTS/BLUETOOTHPro - Its accessories are all generic. It is so nice to buy an extra cable for $2. I know I can buy 3rd party apple cables but some fit well and some are so tight you may damage the phone. I LOVE not having to deal with that - although switching all my phone docks and cables did cost a few bucks. If the next iPhone switches its port, I wouldn't be able to use them anyway.Pro - The earphone jack. I am no audiophile and have gone wireless for audio in most ways. But by design, my car connects phones to the radio with an audio cable. This phone requires nothing new to use that. Its an added plus when I forget to charge my wireless headphones.Con - The usb c connection just doesn't feel as tight to me.  When I connect the cable it doesnt align straight as easily as the lightning connector - even with using the cables provided with phone. Also, I get errors from different chargers that the phone is not connected completely. I think the error is because the phone is expecting a fast charger, but it has me a little concerned about reliability in the back of my mind.AUTHENTICATION/SECURITYPro - Eyescanner is great for unlocking phone. I've had better restults than many reviews. Mine will usually scan me correctly from a reading position if I pull the phone up toward my face about 2 feet. Even in dim light it usually reads which greatly reduces this next con.Con - I am sooo used to the fingerscanner, it is an unatural action to unlock ANYTHING on this phone. The placement is not where I can reach it naturally so I have to shift the phone to scan and it has gotten to be a real pain in the ass when I unlock apps.Con - Eyescanner either does not work to unlock apps (like paypal, etc) or it isn't coded in a way to easily connect it. It seem to only unlock phone.Con - Did I mention logging into apps is a pain in the ass on this phone? Dashlane is an app that makes this a bit more bearable but once you know how easy it is on Apple it is hardly comparable replacment. If you use financial apps, you will dedicate some time to trying to get around this. I think on the standard phone the fingerprint scanner felt more accessible so this may be an issue specific to the plus model.Meh - Facescanner is available but a photo can unlock the phone. As easily hacked as this is, I don't see the point of using this. Maybe if I wanted to lock a younger child out of my phone. Anyone over the age of 8 that wants to get into your phone will get past this lock.Meh - I generally don't feel as secure with my data in the apps, OS, and features of this phone and the android infrastructure. Many find this a pro since you can choose all these different apps to help. It is the same feeling when I use my windows computer, security is all on my shoulders and I better address it someway. And all the free solutions have ads. Apple has a great track record with securing data, privacy, etc. Everything I read about setting up android points you to security features to enable. Am I protected? I've installed some suggested apps, but who the hell knows.CUSTOMIZATIONPro - Out of the box, this phone is one of the most highly customizable phones available to change your experience to how you want the phone to look and behave. You can add and remove features of the OS (like the app drawer which iphone users do not have), edit how app icon looks, rename or remove app names, etc. Some customizations are pretty sweet - like backgrounds can move with movement of the phone and the camera can be used to sync the background with whatever colors the camera is capturing.Pro - The keyboard can be reduced in size and offset to the side of your prominent hand so that the keys are easy to reach with one hand. If the Big Con for word prediction didnt exist, this might be a reason to change phones when using plus size.Meh - Speech of OS. It is good but Apple does relistic speech better.Con (if new to android) - It is overwhelming to use this phone out of the box without some grounding first. It may be licensing or userbase expectation, but there are dual applications for many functions. It is preinstalled with Samsungs version of chat, email, and browser apps as well as the Android standard equivilent. As you set these up and start using them, they'll be prompting back and forth to change defaults. Some are similarly named and the functions between each have nothing dictating where the app settings will be located, how to engage the settings, etc. The OS does not have any wizard guiding you through steps in an order that makes sense. Apple sort of walks you through step by step of creating your Apple account first, then security choices, etc. You get none of that here. You keep tinkering with creating accounts and settings until something works, then you move onto the next thing you want to work. It may take a week to get this phone to replace an iPhone completely if you use many apps at all.Big Con - Using the keyboard drives me close to insanity because of how often the wrong word appears. It is functional (I've defaulted to using Gboard after some comparing of 3rd party) but it takes about twice the effort as iPhone. If I hadn't used iPhone I likely wouldn't notice but I have used one and I notice this fault - every time I have to type an email or text message.Con - I have some loss in trust in settings to take and work as expected. I've had this phone ring at work when I thought I had do not disturb set. I do not know why the setting changed and it was easy enough to address, but you must click and look for check marks, okays, enable, save buttons that iPhone never requires you to click.  There is no standard across the platform so unless you exit and go back into a setting, I never know it took.Big Con (for my use) - Enabling handicap features can be painful. On iPhone, I can set my phone up to triple tap to enable text to speech so the OS will read aloud to me. I use this very often to have kindle books read to me without having to rely on audible or paying for whispersync books. Enabling this on android is very difficult and it will not continue to read past a paragraph max. If someone has figured this out, please respond with comment.Big Big Big Con - Ads, ads, everywhere. Do you like having your phone boot into a screen with a big ad displayed in the middle of it? Well android provides that functionality - in fact every developer over uses it in a way iPhone users do not experience. Once you customize and get some crazy ad resulting, you'll need an app to find what is causing it. In fact, I almost returned this phone on day 2 because of an ad. And I got some good advice I'm passing along to you if you keep reading.FUNCTIONSPro - Best 3d experience available on a phone. For under $10 you can get a 3d headset for your phone and be immersed in some pretty awsome videos. Yes, iPhone does this too, but Samsung does it better. What I did not know is that the experience is 360 degrees. You'll need to stand up to turn around and see what is behind you, but when you are flying in that jet, you can see the pilot if you turn around. I watched a cartoon with aliens in front of me and rabbit hiding behind me and I missed half of the action because I kept trying to check what the rabbit was doing. This is not something I need to have in anyway, but it is fun and costs very little to get set up. Be forewarned, you will be seasick after your first use and riding a rollercoaster standing up in 3d can make you fall down.Pro - Audio over wireless just sounds better to me compared to iPhone 6. I don't know about other versions but with same headsets I get more bass, etc.Meh - Phone calls are okay but I'm not impressed with the app. It is harder to use and integration between apps is not all that great. Here are some of the items harder than iPhone - answering a call, finding and calling a contact, setting up a 3way call, adding a new call into a current call (still haven't gotten it to happen), selecting a phone number in another app and having phone app open and call.Meh - Bixby is Samsungs response to Siri (and Google Assistant which is on this phone also).  In concept Bixby should develop into something more useful than Siri for chaining commands together (set this setting and opne this app, or open this app and do this), but it is not fully realized yet. Having to hold the button for the duration of the command comes difficult to me and it feels unnecessary and I just don't like it. And I don't like that button anyway. Engaging google assistant is the same as Siri and I like that way of turning it on better. I've used Siri more so I know what to expect and I know what it does. I have less favorable results with both of these but Bixby was only recently enabled. I think it may develop into something pretty nice to use if Samsung will rethink that button and the requirement to hold it for the duration of the command. And honestly about half the time I've clicked on the Bixby button, I was trying to hold my phone or adjust my volume - bad placment.Con - One better like clicking okay and yes to use these apps. Android suffers from the same thing Windows does. You have to click an extra time or 2 to get a function to set. Even when logging in right now, I may have to push the home button, then swipe up, enter a code, and then click an ok to proceed. On my iphone, I pushed the home button and let my finger rest there and I was in. The majority of system settings and apps have similar unneccessary extra selections and swipes.Con - Speech to text in voice assistants, text message or email is truly unpredictable. I did not truly appreciate how well Apple does this until I stopped using it on this phone. It is really that bad in most real life situations that I want to use it.Big Con - There is an emergency call button (it will dial 911 if you click it) that is badly placed on the unlock screen. I conciously have to avoid hitting that stupid thing 20 to 40 times a day. It's these things that seriously puts iPhone ahead of Samsung in actual usage.  I don't have issue with it there, but I need option to move it up on screen where I won't accidentally hit it. I CANNOT BE THE ONLY PERSON THAT HATES THIS.Big Con - Audio volume is ok for music apps but it has an annoying warning about excessive volumes damaging hearing that I want to disable forever and it won't let me. I wouldn't mind seeing the warning and have it go away in a couple of seconds, but you must interact with the warning manually. It is especially irritating because of this next big con.Con - Audio in apps are extremely low when using cabled headsets and at least some on wireless. One example is podcast apps. I have to max out the phone volume and increase my car stereo volume to hear them at the same volume of songs. I use a jabra headset when driving in my car - it's what I used to use with my iPhone and the same issue is present with it. I don't know how many apps are affected, and it may be setting related, but it is an issue out of the box.Con - Videos do not go full screen by flipping screen sideways. In almost every instance iPhone does this by default. It is not the case here - ofen it takes a click or 2 to get that to take.APPSPro - Multiple app stores to download products.Pro - Because android allows more access to hardware and OS, there are apps for a whole different use than what Apple apps provide. There are many apps to add functionality to the phone. The phone can go into silent mode or reduce its volume anytime you arrive at work for example. You can change your icons from developer default to marbles with the app name listed on them.Meh - Apps are mostly as functional as what IOS equivilent provides, but they aren't streamlined for ease of use. I miss my iPhone apps quite a bit.Con - Most underground app stores likely have viruses in part of their offered apps.Con - Most free apps have ads.Big Con - Unless you are willing to download apps from 'risky' locations, apps without ads are double or triple the price on Apple. I rarely see any paid for app include an ad but I see many paid for apps include apps after purchase.UNTESTEDNA - Provided headphones. They are marketed to be $100 street value but I use wireless audio and haven't had the need to test yet.And here are my suggestions for those not used to Android:Don't do as I did. As soon as I got basics down (before I sorted out what I needed to work), I hit the store and got lost in downloading free apps. Before I knew it I had a bunch of apps I didn't remember the function for and I included a launcher that sounded soooo great.  And then I figured out what came with those downloads - apps. I was UNHAPPY for a day with an app on my home screen. It was from the launcher by the way. The launcher made me about half crazy trying to work against it. So, if you are stuck in this mode, uninstall, uninstall, uninstall. Airpush Detector is an app that can help identify sources of ads.Stay with Samsung's default touchwiz launcher at first.  A launcher gives you a look and feel to the device and determines what functions you can add and remove from the settings.  When new to android, touchwiz gives plenty to play with and see what is available and you don't get embedded ads up front.Put the settings app somewhere you can find it easily.By default, the touchwiz launcher gives you a main landing screen that has a google search field and the primary row of phone related apps you see on every screen and one seconadary row of icons that belongs to this landing screen only. When you scroll to the right, the primary row will go with the view and the secondary will go offscreen with the rest of that landing screen. The idea is that the apps on the secondary row are your most frequently used apps along with the main phone apps on the primary row. When you scroll to the screen to the right, that screen is similar to what iPhone screens look like - a grid for placing apps over a chosen background. Each time you scroll to the right you can add one of these grid screens as iPhone does. Something not found on iPhone is an app drawer. It is available from each screen, if you swipe upward on the primary row - there is an up arrow on the primary row indicating the app drawer and you can choose to keep or remove a dedicated button that opens it as well. That drawer has a default copy of every app installed on the phone. If you want one on any of the main screens, press and hold an app inside the app drawer and it will let you pull it upward out of the drawer and it will drop to whatever location you release it at. The copy will remain in the drawer unless you explicitely delete or hide it from there.If you already know you don't like the app drawer concept, you can remove it and the upward screen swipe function will go away and all installed apps will drop onto the those grid screens - just like how iPhone behaves. If you are getting lost looking for apps, go ahead and remove the app drawer now to get closer to the iPhone default setup: Settings app icon > Display > Home screen > Home screen layout.  I suggest adding it back at a later date to see if you like it later; once there isn't so much to get used to at once.You likely are used to having a set of apps on the main row of your homescreen from whatever smart phone you come from. Change the row of apps on the primary row to match what you currently use and set those apps up for use.The timeout to black out the screen is way too fast when one is trying to figure out how to configure the phone. Go to settings and change setting not to lock if looking at screen.  Bixby can help find - just hold the button and ask to change that setting. If you have no Samsung account, you get to set up your account now.The phone is likely completely unlocked to anyone - you should set up security at some point - I suggest setting the passcode, the fingerprint scanner & the iris scanner. You'll be unlocking the phone once you do this, so decide if you want to do this now or later.The phone comes with 2 app stores installed, they are Samsung Market and Google Playstore.  I do not group my apps by developer. I group them by what they do. I suggest you pull the apps out of any folders they are in and put the near each other.  I usually look in the Samsung Marker first to see if there is a version of an app developed specifically for this phone and if not, I look in Google Playstore which will be developed for android phones in general.Next get some sort of security on the phone. Most carriers will have some sort of security app pre-installed. Launch it and make sure it is set up. I also installed Avast from one of the app store due to its popularity across android forums.If you are like me, you now have lots of apps running in the background. Press the dedicated recent softkey next to the home button. It is indicated by 2 arrows making a box. You can close them all.Initially, I was getting confused by apps provided to do same thing. Select an app for each function and remove the other app.Messaging clients: I hid Messages (it wont uninstall) & stayed with message+ until I could navigate the OS easily.Browsers: This is a difficult choice. Samsung Internet(purple globe) is designed to be integrated with this phones hardware and shows to be most similar to iPhone's browser for efficiency.  In my usage, it blocked sites that Chrome didn't and that I didn't feel were unsafe.  If you have no preference and gmail isn't your default form of communicating, I'd disable Chrome (no uninstall available) unless you have same issue I had. If you are tied to gmail, I'd use Chrome and hide/uninstall Internet if it'll let you.If you were using an iPhone before, Samsung has provided an app called Smart Switch to hook to your iPhone with provided hardware in the box (the one with the usb hookup adapter) and it will scan your iPhone and set up your contacts, move your photos if you have room, and find matching apps from the stores.  I'd run that at this time.Now go find a free background or theme you like in one of the stores.Select what displays on your always on display.Set up your apps and you should be set to use the phone for a bit.Once you are comfortable using all that you have set up - maybe a day or 2, set up the edge app. You'll have a better idea by that time what might be nice to have on that shortcut.Other Suggestions:Set do not disturb on a schedule (in the settings app) if you get woken up by text messages and such at night.Block blue light with sunset (in the settings app) - supposedly reduces affects of phone screen on your sleep.Set finger scanner to swipe down to pull notifications open - honestly I dont use it, but go ahead - it's kind of cool.Note:You cannot delete apps that are sitting on the primary apps bar - you must relocate it to the grid. Depending on app, it may not allow uninstall, but you may be able to disable and/or hide.  Worst case, make a folder and hide all unused apps in it.After a few days, research what a widget is and set one up on one of your screens - Maybe a calendar or a clock.After a few more days, research what ""edge"" apps are available to you.Some apps that I'm using:Ad source finder- air push detector (suggested by coworker)Downloaded & changed keyboard to GBoard (suggested by forums and tested well against others I tried)Ad blocker - Crystal Ad blocker (can't remember why I chose this)Pw manager - Dashlane shows up top in many reviews (you have to engage the app to set up the pw)Browser - Puffin pro (free has ads) for speed of use - but it has a drawback of memory consumption compared to other browsersChat client - Textra (mainly testing from high reviews)Widget - I'm using a widget called Month to put a calendar on one of my grid screens.",4.0
93,Amazon,Samsung S8,"This phone was rated as ""good"" from warehouse deals. When it arrived it was in the factory box and looked like it had never been opened.  The plastic was still on the screen. I found no scratches or imperfections. My carrier is Sprint. It is truly unlocked for all carriers.They had me hooked up in about 15 minutes. The clerk asked me if i had bought the phone new from Samsung directly. He told me it was the unlocked version that would work internationally too.I have had the phone a couple of weeks and it has performed flawlessly. This was another great buy for me here on Amazon. If you are on the fence like I was about upgrading to the S8, go ahead and buy one here, its just an awesome phone. I had an S5 that was great but this S8 is so much better. Trust me on this. Go ahead and buy it. You will be amazed too!",5.0
94,Amazon,Samsung S8,"I upgraded to this S8 from my S6 Edge since I was getting fed up with the capped storage capacity at 64GB otherwise I probably would have waited another year or 2. (And sun spots which burned permanent purple dots on my front facing cam. . .)This phone has some upgrades which I personally enjoy:-Battery Capacity. Holy cow. This thing actually lasts me over 10 hours of almost constant Netflix streaming with brightness at 75% with bluetooth wireless earbuds and that only bring its to about 30-35% battery. It then still lasts the rest of the day at 25% brightness taking it down to just about 15% battery. (I normally start charging it up once it hits 20% though)-Camera Function: Incredibly fast focus and quality. (Only minor con is that it's not amazing in low light, using ProMode helps a bit though)-Smooth touchscreen with a lot of customization features within the phone itself.-Being an unlocked phone, minimal bloatware comes on the phone. (Sadly there are some things...)-You can easily turn Bixby off if you don't like it. (The camera item search/translator is pretty fun though!)-Always on display is actually really helpful for me since I don't have to reach over to see the time if I randomly wake up in the middle of the night. I keep it simple without a background and just colorized text, so it doesn't seem to consume much battery even if it's. . . always on. (You can also set it up to show during certain hours in a day.)-It still allows your to insert microphone jacks.-USB-C, I personally like it since I dont have to worry about turning it around to fit anymore. (Box also comes with some adapters.)-And obviously the MiscroSD storage. Stuck a 128GB card in there upon arrival.Some downsides on the phone:-Fully made of glass. It's not cheap feeling in the slightest, but it makes you a bit more paranoid if it does fall. (Highly recommend a good case for this phone)-Wish this came with a non-Edge version. Honestly don't enjoy it that much and causes issues with a lot of screen protectors, but I couldn't pass up the sale on the phone.-Comes pre-installed with Facebook. I don't use facebook so it's just an annoying app chilling on my phone which I'd rather have completely uninstalled instead of just disabled.-Bixby button. . . well that thing is just kinda there. I don't hit it often but when I do it's just mildly inconvenient. Thankfully my case has little ridges on the button which make it easier to locate the volume when needed. The button can become an issue on some phone stands though.This phone was able to hit all the things that I want in a phone: Good camera, long battery life, adjustable storage, crisp display, and functional.All in all, I very much enjoy this phone with only minor gripes which aren't enough to make me dislike the phone at all.(Yes, this phone works with most if not all carriers. That includes Verizon. You can even see this written on Samsung's fine print for the phone. You may need to have the SIM card activated in another phone first then switch it into your S8.)",5.0
95,Amazon,Samsung S8,"The Galaxy S8 is a solid, quality phone based on my use of it over the past month+.  It was a welcome upgrade to my S5, which had become terribly buggy and crash-prone with the latest software updates.  I hesitated to give Samsung another try after so many later problems with the S5.In the end it was worth the upgrade.  As expected, the S8 was fast and slick, although some of the standard apps suffer from usability changes for the worse, compared to the S5.  I have come to expect this with any major software/hardware upgrade so it's hardly worth mentioning.Of note however, is the hoops I had to jump through to get this phone working with Verizon.  This review has less to do with any issues with the phone itself (there have been almost none) and more to do with the general incompetence of the specific staff at my local Verizon store.This unlocked 64GB phone is perfectly compatible with the Verizon network and now is working great; however, the Verizon store employees were unable to get my phone working out of the box because it was not a ""Verizon Branded"" S8.  Do yourself a favor; call Verizon tech support to get it figured out.  After almost a full day of fruitlessly working with the store employees and managers and being sent on one wild goose chase after another, a 15 minute call to Verizon tech support resolved everything.Note that this phone takes a mini SIM card and can't simply be swapped from the S5; this is why I had to endure a trip to the local Verizon store at all.Also note; if activating this unlocked phone on Verizon, they will not allow you to download or install their standard Verizon voicemail app.  You will be required to download another voicemail app/service from the Google app store.  Not a big deal; Youmail fits the bill just fine for me.Other than those few minor bumps, it was much worth getting the unlocked S8 on Amazon for hundreds less, without being stuffed to the gills with bloatware, compared to the Verizon branded S8.",4.0
96,Amazon,Samsung S8,hello i bought the Samsung galaxy but when the phone detects moisture it doesn’t charge the battery. How can I fix it?,2.0
97,Amazon,Samsung S8,"The good: I'm really glad that I got this over spending more for a Verizon phone. There's less garbage on it from the carrier (and the few things that it tried to install when I inserted the SIM card were able to be uninstalled). The battery life is pretty crazy. Even without the power saver mode turned on, it lasts all day. Switch on power saver mode and it won't use hardly any power unless the screen is turned on. The curved screen doesn't cause issues with the touch screen while using it one-handed, and is positively gorgeous. People actually ask me what phone I have. The camera is super fast and takes amazing pictures.The bad: Bixby is not what it's cracked up to be in my opinion. Sure it can do some cool stuff, but 90% of the time it's not helpful. Additionally, there's a really quick, perceptible wait for the microphone to turn on when you hold the button down. I also tend to push the button (or it gets pushed as it's going into my pocket) on accident. For some reason when I type the microphone key on the keyboard to do voice dictation, it refuses to use the Google voice recognition engine. It's not really slick so it won't fall out of your hand, but when I put it screen down on my nightstand, there's some coating or something on the screen that will actually let the phone slowly slide around (because the table isn't 100% level).",4.0
98,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Im not going to get into huge detail here, but I love this phone.The Camera is amazingThe screen is amazingThe fingerprint scanner works better than everyone says it does.I have taken this phone in the shower with me multiple times. 0 problems.it played music underwater (not recommended) with 0 problems.It does take a little getting used to, but the longer I have it, the more I love it.Honestly I can't think of one thing I don't like.except that I wish the bixby button was programmable.And I would recommend the otterbox Defender series case. Ive had it for weeks and it has been incredible.",5.0
99,Amazon,Samsung S8,"First let me get this out of the way: This phone for the most part is awesome. The specs are beastly, the camera is among the best in class, the 1440p bezel-less curved display looks amazing, and the features this phone has is vast and actually useful in everyday usage. But while this phone is objectively one of the best out right now, it is also one of the most fragile. The backglass on mine broke within a week of usage and I actually had to replace the backglass in order to fix this. To put it in context, the only other phone glass that I have ever broke is the iPod Touch 4th gen, and I had that for nearly 2 years of usage before that happened. This is not a durable phone in the slightest, and I would highly recommend getting a case or skin for it if you plan to get this phone. Outside of that, this is a great phone and I'd recommend it assuming you are cautious enough to avoid issues",4.0
100,Amazon,Samsung S8,"the phone in itself is fine. i bought this with a trade in phone so supposedly i was getting $125 for the old phone. well, a month later, samsung sales came back to say sorry, your item does not qualify for trade in so we charging you 125 dollars extra. i asked to return the s8 here as clearly this was now beyond my budget. well, you wish. they said i had only 15 days after the purchase day to return it so i am stuck now with an over priced item. i am still reporting Samsung to the Federal Trade Commission to try to resolve this issue (after all, how was i supposed to return within 15 days when they rejected the item a month later, clearly the 15 days should apply to the moment the buyer has all the final costs charged). anyways beware of the dirty tricks that samsung plays with the customer. if you come to rely on their support, you may as well be on your own.",2.0
101,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Been an iPhone user since the 4, up until this baby came into my life. Initially I was scared to take the leap but I'm glad I did. The s8 is the most beautiful phone I've come across and I'm so happy that it's mine. It does everything I need and more. If you're thinking about switching to Android, this is the sign for you to take that leap.Fast shipping & perfect condition! All I had to do to activate mine (w Verizon) was transfer my sim card from my 6+ to the s8 and voila! I'm a very happy girl with my new s8 :)",5.0
102,Amazon,Samsung S8,overall after having this device for a little while it is a decent device clean video playback and great camera however the few minor issues keeping this from being a higher review the back glass is very brittle the screen is decent as for durability and great for playback my review would be a 4 star except for the fact that once i downloaded the update that was ready to be installed out of the box (i waited a month before installing so i could see what all was impacted by it) i have noticed a slight decline in battery life and complete loss of the microphone in calls unless i have speakerphone on or an external headset i will update this post if and when a new update comes around to fix that problem.finally would i recommend this phone? yes i would as long as you keep a headset as part of your daily routine or chose to not install the updates.Updated rating up to 4 stars as the December update has fixed all problems with the microphone and no longer requireing a head set to use as a phone,4.0
103,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Pros: The phone is fast.Good battery life.Very nice looking phone.Display looks very nice.Cons:  My hand would often unintentionally touch a part of the wrap around screen and close browser windows, apps, etc.  This happened often enough to be fairly annoying.Several apps were buggy and would close by themselves or would just not work at all (such as cycletrader app).  There were some annoying quirks with the youtube app.The fingerprint reader is the worst I've used yet, it always took at least 3 or 4 tries every time I got my phone out.  Super annoying.Facial recognition on this phone is a joke.I don't like Samsung's overlay on Android Nougat.  The Samsung keyboard sucks. Stock Android is so much nicer IMO.Overall, for a flagship phone and even at a deeply discounted price I wasn't too impressed with this one.  I have a feeling I would be much happier with a Pixel or the upcoming Pixel 2.",3.0
104,Amazon,Samsung S8,"So, the makers of this phone decided to add a personal assistant that pops up whenever you click a button on the side. I have everything integrated with Google and have no need for another personal assistant nor any desire to test one out. But, I constantly accidentally hit this button, and this thing that I have no desire/need for constantly pops up, usually right when you're in the middle of something.""But why don't you just disable it?"" you might say. Well, they make you sign up for an account and go through a whole process just to get to the screen where you can disable the button. So, after a month of aggravation, I finally decided to go through the hassle of disabling this stupid thing that I have not desire nor need for. Well, ok, I finally get it disabled, but having to give it my personal information and such, and who know what kind of data it's gathering. Not to mention power it uses, data it uses, and taking up a whole screen constantly to the left of the main screen. So, I decide to disable the app entire. Well, there's like 4 apps it uses, and you have to disable all of them. But, surprise, Samsung deliberately makes it impossible to disable.So, this all seems like a grand ploy to force you to use their personal assistant, and they figure that you've already bought the phone and won't go through the hassle of returning it, accustoming yourself with another phone, etc.. But take it from me, save yourself. Get a different phone now.",1.0
105,Amazon,Samsung S8,"I'm going to start out this review by stating that I have basically hated the Galaxy S phones since they've come out.  I loved my old Samsung flip phone, but when they made the move to Android, I just couldn't get into them.  I read how amazing the Super AMOLED screen was, and I thought it was garbage.  It was grainy and the colors were much too garish and off.  The UI was cartoony and had weird colors.  Over the years, though, Samsung slowly stripped away the bloat, refined their screens, cleaned up their Android skin, and after all this time I can finally say that they've sold me.The feel:The first thing I noticed with this phone was how amazing it feels.  It's crazy thin, and encased in cool, smooth curved glass.  It has just the right amount of heft to make it feel premium.  It feels like a smooth, elegant and flat pebble.  With the infinity screen it (and its brothers the S8+ and Note 8) is easily the most attractive phone I've ever seen, a departure from the older Galaxy S phones which had never struck an aesthetic note with me.While the elongated shape of the phone seems odd at first, and actually makes the screen more narrow than other flagships, it works well for accessing the entire screen with one hand.  While it's still a stretch, it's more managable that way and makes the new on-screen navigation keys less obtrusive.  Speaking of the on-screen keys, I've never been a fan until now.  They work well and the home ""button"" even has a vibrating ""click"" when you press it in, which I like for turning on your screen and unlocking it in one shot.The physical buttons are a bit too easy to accidentally press, which I don't like, and the Bixby button (which I'll get to later) is unnecessary and makes the volume keys harder to find.As much as I like the design, this phone NEEDS a case.  I don't mean that as a bad thing, although for some people I'm sure it will be.  It's delicate.  The all-glass design makes it highly vulnerable to breaking, as you'll find reading reviews and watching drop tests.  The edge display detects accidental touches on occasion.  The volume keys are too clicky.  The phone is thin and smooth which makes it too easy to drop.  A case solves all of these problems.  Even if I didn't work in construction (which I do), I would put a case on this phone.  I personally went with the Spigen Rugged Armor Samsung Galaxy S8 Case, Spigen® [Rugged Armor] Galaxy S8 Case Cover with Resilient Shock Absorption and Carbon Fiber Design for Galaxy S8 (2017) - Black- 565CS21609 case, which I highly recommend.  There's even a Youtube video where a guy drops it on tile floor and it just bounces, with no damage whatsoever.Software:For years Samsung's TouchWiz was bloated and ugly.  I hated the cartoony look and the garish colors (which were made worse by the extreme oversaturation of the Super AMOLED screen).  But now, with the paring down of bloat, it's finally become useable.  A while back Samsung also introduced a theme engine into their phones and I'm glad they did.  I was able to change all of the default Samsung apps and menus into the black shades that I love so much.  You can even replace the icons with a different themes, although I ended up using Nova Launcher with some icons I had bought for it.I like the way Samsung has set up their apps.  They are clean, usable, intuitive, but still full of handy features.  Probably my least favorite is the Gallery, although my complaints are minor.  My issue is that the pictures are all clumped into a giant, solid wall of pictures, which makes it difficult to differentiate between each file.  The little overlays that tell you if it's a video or a photo, etc. are in plain white text that sometimes is hard to read against lighter pictures.  But the email app, dialer, calendar, system menus, etc. are all a pleasure to use.  Everything runs fast and I even found myself using the split screen feature for the first time ever (I had to do some calculator work and type numbers into a spreadsheet) which impressed me.There is still bloat though.  Samsung has a bunch of redundant features that mirror those of Google's, which aggravates me.  It would be fine if I planned on sticking to the Samsung phone ecosystem for the rest of my life, but I'm not even close to making that commitment.  I still use all of Google's services, because I can use them on any Android phone.  You get Samsung Calendars, Samsung Health, Samsung Pay (which I'll elaborate more on), Samsung backup, and others.  It's mostly not a chore to use Google's features instead, but you really need to pay attention on things like the calendars and contacts to make sure you're using their Google equivilants.To be honest I didn't even try Bixby.  Google Assistant is more than I need, and I don't like having an extra home screen or a button specifically for Samsung's digital assistant.  Fortunately you can completely disable both the button and the service, but you have to fully enable it and set it up before you can do that.  The button is not capable of being set for anything else, so if you disable Bixby you basically end up with a useless button on the side of your phone.The Galaxy S8 has the infinity edge screen so that means it comes with the Edge shortcuts.  This is a menu you can slide out from the side of your screen and run apps, call contacts, etc. with.  There are actually a ton of extra features and screens you can download for it, but in the end I didn't see the need for one more thing on my screen.  That being said, I think that if a person set it up and used it regularly, it may become a handy feature.Samsung Pay is a feature I was surprised by.  My phone came with a promotional $50 credit via Samsung Pay so I was obligated to use it.  The first time I tried it, it was just like in the commercial: the cashier assured me that they couldn't do it, and she clumsily fumbled with the card scanner trying to figure out just how it was going to happen.  I calmly reached over and waved my phone over the reader, and like magic, it accepted payment.  I got a receipt on my phone and happily went on my way.  I've used it three times total, and the first two times it worked, but the third it failed even though the reader specifically said it worked with Samsung Pay.  As cool as the first two times were, I didn't appreciate looking like a fool while I waved my phone around a card reader like an idiot.Hardware:Another feature I was surprised by was the fingerprint reader.  I found myself using it in my money apps, which makes them much simpler.  It's very quick and let me log into my Wells Fargo and Paypal apps instantly, which is convenient for checking balances, sending payments, etc.  Yes, the reader has a terrible location next to the camera.  However, this is another feature that is fixed by putting a case on your phone.  Once you have a cutout for the camera, your finger can easily find the edge of the hole where the reader lies, making it essentially a non-issue.Battery life so far has been great.  This is the seventh Android phone I've owned, and I don't recall any of them getting phenomenal battery life.  My galaxy S5 I briefly owned (used, to replace an LG G3 with a cracked screen) got terrible life but that could have been other factors.  This one gets me through a full work day with moderate social media use, and in today's world that's the most I hope for from a cell phone.  I do have to put it on the charger in the evening, but only briefly and then it gets me through bedtime.  The battery is not removable however so keep that in mind.I've never tried wireless charging before, but I did with this phone simply because the chargers are cheap and easily available, and I had to buy new cables anyway for the new USB C standard, so I snagged a wireless charger from Amazon.  I didn't use the Samsung charger or cable so I'm sure it could have been faster, but in about 4 hours it filled up the battery from almost dead.  This works well for me for charging overnight, but you can't use your phone while it's lying on the pad so it might not be great for other uses.Call quality has been wonderful.  The volume of the ear speaker is actually more than I need, which is a good thing.  I'd rather turn the audio volume down on a call then top it out and wish it would go louder.  The external speaker is adequate, not being overly quiet but not really sounding impressive in any way.  I didn't get any complaints on speakerphone mode.The screen almost needs its own catagory.  As I stated, for years I've hated Super AMOLED.  I don't get how people thought the early screens looked good.  The saturation was so high, and the colors were off, so that when the brightness was up (and these displays are bright) it made my eyes bleed.  But finally, with this phone, I feel that the colors and saturation are perfect.  The screen is super bright too, and in fact Samsung's auto-brightening technology learns what setting you use at different light levels, making this the first Android phone I've ever had auto-brightness turned on with.  The resolution is actually turned down when you buy the phone, which I recommend not messing with.  You can turn it up to 4k, but it's not needed and the battery will be drained more quickly.  As it is, pictures and text are extremely clear.  Everything just looks so great on this screen, I find myself staring at it sometimes just to admire it.  The infinity edge feels good too, giving it a nice rolled over feel when you swipe towards the sides.  The phone has a feature called always on display, which leaves the clock, battery percentage, and little notification icons on your screen even when it's locked.  The brightness is turned down so that you don't get screen burn-in, and I found that I liked this feature, which didn't seem to affect battery drain.The camera is one of the reasons I bought this phone.  I've heard for a few years now that Apple and Samsung cameras are always neck and neck in quality.  In practice, I'm mostly happy with my choice.  In well lit conditions pictures come out wonderful.  Colors are great and they've very clear.  Burst shots are amazing, shooting literally 60 pictures in about a second.  Low light shots were a mixed bag, though.  The lighting in the pictures is definitely brighter than in real life, which is great, but for whatever reason once you hit a certain threshold the colors become washed out and any movement at all causes blurring.  This is a problem common to cameras and is related to aperture and shutter speed, but I honestly expected this phone camera to do better.  Perhaps it's a setting I need to enable, but as of right now I was a little disappointed.  However, if this phone camera is near the top of the heap, I suppose I don't have much choice but to accept it.Summary:I know this has been a long-winded review but a phone is a major purchase in a person's life and I feel like I needed to share my full experience to buyers.Overall I love this phone.  There are no major issues with it and using it is a joy.  I'm sure it's partly the new phone effect, but I find myself trying to come up with reasons to use it so I can enjoy the beautiful screen and snappy performance.  It has a few minor flaws here and there, and a bit of the obligatory Samsung bloat, but so far it's been a wonderful experience.  I would highly recommend it.",5.0
106,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Ordered this device while Harvey was ongoing. There was a slight delay, but that was inevitable due to the inclement weather. Arrived within the time frame and Amazon notified me, as and when there were delays.The device was grouped with the Case and Screen Protector that I had ordered, which was very convenient. Packaging was secure which is expected for this device at such a price range.Overall, the phone is brilliant. Sharp display, clear camera images with AF. It runs all apps like a breeze and is well suited for heavy multitasking. The bezel-less display is a joy to look at and reading on it is very comfortable. It also ships with USB (B to C) and (A to C) adapters, which helps during our transition to USB C type plugs.The battery life is amazing, for a phone with such a sharp and bright display, and also considering the hardware. The 3500mAh battery offers enough juice for an entire day of light usage. Heavy use - like watching movies or playing games like Real Racing, etc. drains it faster, but that is expected from demanding apps.The issue of the fingerprint sensor being too close to the camera is real for the first few days; but after using it as your daily driver, you tend to figure out where it is and it doesn't pose much of a bother, unless you deliberately want to smudge your camera lens.I would highly recommend this device to anyone with a moderately high budget. It looks amazing and performs much better than it looks. I would also recommend to get a protector case (the rear side is a fingerprint magnet and you wouldn't want to crack this amazing display) and a screen protector. To all those having second thoughts, I would say: Go for it!",5.0
107,Amazon,Samsung S8,"UPDATE 12/22/17: My phone is still going strong and looks pretty much the same as when I first got it. I'm still using the same Speck Candyshell Grip case and same liquid install screen protector. They are in great shape and providing enough protection tor my phone. The glitchy stuff seems to have mostly been fixed after an update. I have the unlocked version. Facebook app has been sucking big time, so I mostly access facebook through a browser and only use the facebook app to post pictures.When picking a phone over the past few months, I tried iphone 6s(hated the locked down feel and it had major battery drain with my music app that could not be fixed, so that was a deal breaker), Huawei Mate 9(Has a good camera, good battery life when battery drain isn't happening, but it isn't optimized for google apps and gets battery drain every couple weeks so I had to reset it all the time, ridiculous), LG G6(Great front camera, loved the wide-angle option, terrible front camera circa 2013 and bad connectivity with my Honda UPlay and Google play music)....And, now the Samsung S8, I have had it for a month now. It takes pretty good pictures. The Mate 9 had more detailed pics, but S8 takes better low-light photos in my experience. I'd say they are about tied for front cameras. The selfie camera is slightly better with the Mate 9 than the S8 because you can adjust more on the Mate 9 and the focus seems to be a little better when people stay in the background of a photo and not side by side. I prefer the Mate 9 photo gallery, too. It's easier to select photos to share. The speakers are a bit quiet and not as nice sounding on the S8 verses the Mate 9. Mate 9 has loud speakers with stereo option when it's side, but the S8 sounds acceptable and is much improved over my old Samsung S3. It's quieter than the LG G6 as well and comparable to the iPhone 6s. I heard the newer iPhones have stereo speakers and get pretty loud, though. But, new model iPhones are too expensive for me and offer less features than android phones at a similar price.So far, the Samsung S8 is still the better phone, it's more reliable, it does not have battery drain and the battery life is consistently allowing 6-7 hrs screen on time if all used in one day or around 5 hrs if used over 2 days. I do have to restart my phone sometimes because of minor glitches here and there. Not often, just a couple times a week, so no biggie. It does have a buggy connection with Google Play Music and Honda Uplay, but it still plays the music, it just causes the menu to flash on and off, but it's ignorable and better than not working like the G6, Mate 9 didn't have this problem, but the battery drain still makes Mate 9 a loser for me. I prefer the smaller feel of the S8. It feels very comfortable to hold as compared to the phablet phones like Mate 9. Samsung S8 has many accessories available to it that Mate 9 did not offer in the US due to lack of popularity. S8 has a car charger option, battery pack charger option, and many cases and screen protector options. I tried a couple cases and found the Speck Candyshell Grip case to be the best, I like that it gives some protection around the edge part of the screen while still leaving you full functionality and it's not bulky. I dropped my phone a couple times in the case from a couple feet up and the phone is unharmed.I used an IQ shield liquid install screen protector and that works well even though it takes longer to install. No issues with it coming loose until now. I don't like the curved phone screen, but the Samsung S8 is one of the best phones available and beats out the competition in my opinion. I got mine for close to $600 with tax, I don't think I would pay more than that. Watch for sales. It's been on sale many times since it's release. I would not recommend buying from Samsung directly. I bought one S8 from Samsung and returned it before going back and buying it again elsewhere. The return through Samsung took a month and I had to contact them a second time before they finally processed the return with some message about getting lost at the facility or something, but they still have a note about receiving it. Amazon is a good place to buy from as long as you buy directly through Amazon and not through a third party. It's nice that they give you a 30 day return period. That's the longest period I have seen anywhere.If you want an Android phone, Samsung is still the best available in the states, in my opinion. There are more nice phones available overseas, but you want to have a US warranty, easily available accessories, etc, that leaves you with Samsung, LG, Google, and iPhone for the most part. One big negative with Samsung is that screen is SUPER expensive to replace. I would not get a Samsung S8 if you are rough on your phones. There is an S8 active available through ATT and it's supposed to release for other carriers and maybe unlocked in the future from what I read. Maybe Amazon will get it, too?",4.0
108,Amazon,Samsung S8,"I have many Samsung products, and am happy with all of them, but I am not happy that this phone requires not just one, but two proprietary pieces in order to charge it properly, or one just to hook it up to another device. It does not have a Micro USB connection, it has an adapter that you need to use just to hook it up to a Micro USB cord. If you plug the USB end into any normal charger, or even a USB port on a computer, the phone takes FOREVER to charge (25% charge over 8 hours). You need to plug the cord into Samsung's ""adaptive fast charger"" in order for it to charge in a reasonable amount of time. The whole reason I buy Android instead of iPhone is because I don't want to have proprietary software, hardware or peripherals, I want to buy things that work across multiple devices. I have Micro USB cords everywhere, at home, in my car, at work, one stashed in my luggage in case I forget to pack one on vacation... now, they are all useless to charge this phone unless I happen to have not one, but both of the proprietary parts needed to charge the thing. Unless, of course, I pay them just to have extras so that I can conveniently charge my phone anywhere that I am. It really seems like Samsung is trying to separate themselves from all other Android products by having their own charging devices, and they even have their own Apps and a Browser. All of this I can avoid if I choose, except the charger part.I, like others, have most everything set up through Google, but Samsung wants to force you to use their Apps and software, like Bixby, their version of a personal assistant. And there is no way to replace Bixby, you can turn it off, but the home key is forever tied to this app. I don't want thing that only work with Samsung, I want things that work with Android.The phone does not have a way to double tap a notification to open it; you need to unlock the phone, then open your notification. I've researched this online, and others have the same complaint and no way to turn on that functionality.",1.0
109,Amazon,Samsung S8,"If Customer Service is important, STAY AWAY. The phone is great but if it needs service, don't count on Samsung to do what they promise. My phone arrived with a scratch in the Gorilla Glass. I talked to a Samsung rep who said they would for sure repair that and we arranged to have my phone sent in. They ask you to send in the charger and cable too, so I did. After a week, I received a $300 quote for the repair I was told would be no charge. By the end of the call, they agreed to fix the scratched glass. Another week went by and I received my phone completely unrepaired and missing my charger and cable. I called back and the rep I spoke to said the repair was approved but somehow it was never authorized so they just sent my phone back to me. After further discussion, they PROMISED to take care of the screen and asked me to send in my phone. I trusted their promise and sent in my phone. After two weeks, I received my phone back, again unrepaired. Another call to customer service later and they couldn't tell me whether they were simply inept or if they had just lied to me. The experience has left me sour for not only Samsung phones but for all other Samsung products as well. As far as I'm concerned, if it's a Samsung, it's not going into my house.",1.0

111,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Just after my support ended, my screen seems to have begun having a hardware issue. Horizontal lines have begun appearing, and it looks to be a hardware issue. Pretty disappointed that the Amazon support does not last longer considering I've seen multiple posts online about this being an issue. I haven't had any drops or water issues with the phone, so it looks like the AMOLED screens become defective after a certain time potentially.  Note that if you contact Samsung about this, they will require you to send your phone back, which can be a problem if you do not have another phone to use during that time. Buyer beware!",1.0

113,Amazon,Samsung S8,"This phone is very fragile, I accidentally dropped it 1 ft high and it broke in 3 different places. It is tough to find a good screen protector that protects the phone and not degrade screen sensitivity. The setting to increase touch sensitivity which was available in the S5 is now gone so there is no way around this problem. The thoughtless design of this phone will not allow you to solve this problem. Either add a ballistic glass protector to the screen which solves the fragility of this phone but turns it into a useless phone since you have to press really hard to get the screen to respond, or not add a glass screen protector which leaves this phone subject to breaking sooner or later. It is as if Samsung intentionally designed the phone so that the screen will break (so they can sell more $200 'gorilla' glass screen'?) Other gimmicks are the 'Bixby' app which pops up constantly if you swipe the phone unintentionally in the wrong direction, and the edge screen which accidentally activates some menus while holding it. So you will have to try to hold this slippery phone by avoiding the front edges which increases the chance of dropping and breaking it.",1.0
114,Amazon,Samsung S8,"The best phone at any price right now.  I'm looking forward to next year when I may go for the Samsung Note.  I was a ten year iPhone user and finally lost patience with Tim Cook and his mediocre product development.  He's no Steve Jobs, not by a long shot...  This is the best phone and still has a proper headphone jack.  Until bluetooth headphones can make it a few days on one charge and can fit in my pocket as compactly as a small set of wired earbuds, I will continue to use a phone with a regular headphone jack.  With Apple and now Google Pixel phones committing to what is obviously a very controversial move, it seems like there may be a bigger agenda.  Maybe one of you software engineers can figure out what is the huge advantage of taking away a feature of the phone without adding to it.  Seems like maybe there is some larger reason, like maybe the bluetooth  headsets allow the companies to track you differently.  Maybe the headsets communicate with every wifi device in the world and tell them what you are doing.  I just don't get why they go out of their way to remove it, when it obviously still fits.  Samsung did it, but these other companies can't?  Got to be more to it.",5.0

119,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Great upgrade from the S5. I switched to using Android from Apple since their phones hasn't refreshed in years. With the last Apple device being the iPhone 4, I gave it a go with Android. Initially hesitant to use Android starting with the HTC Evo, but eventually after testing out Samsung Galaxy line, I decided it's worth a shot. One thing I love about the S8 is the Infinity Display. Love how responsive it is, how thin the phone is, and how less susceptible the phone is to scratches. If you're looking for a tempered glass screen protector with this phone, I'd recommend the Galaxy S8 Screen Protector, Poetic [Full Coverage][HD Clear][Case Friendly][Anti-Fingerprint] Premium Edge-to-Edge Tempered Glass Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S8 (Clear). It covers most of the phone's screen except where the ear speakers, cameras, and iris scanner are.",4.0
120,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Amazon was having a $200 off deal on this when I purchased, which... is really good for a new phone, actually. I moved to this from the S5, and it's a big change. Overall this is very slick, fast, and high-performing. I like it much better than the S5--everything is faster and more responsive. The edgeless screen made me nervous at first, but the case I purchased seems to protect it okay. I've dropped it a couple times already from a distance of about 2-3 feet, face down and in its case, and it's been fine. If it breaks within a year, I'll update my review accordingly.My favorite feature is that its narrower--I like big phones, but I don't have big hands, so they can be exhausting to hold after a while. This one is just the right size to easily hold in one hand, while still having excellent screen real estate. It's not very heavy, which makes it easy to continuously read and interact on it one-handed, too, even with a heavier case.My least favorite feature is Bixby--while it has its uses, it really isn't that great at interacting with apps or hearing commands properly. It won't open non-Google apps on command, which is a huge pain, and half the time seems to mishear me even when I speak directly into the microphone and enunciate very clearly. Right now I solely use it to turn off the always on display at night, which seems like a waste for what could otherwise be a very powerful tool. It's actually kind of bizarre that it's as bad as it is, considering how many voice-controlled devices are on the market right now.",5.0
121,Amazon,Samsung S8,"I feel the need to warn people--do not buy this phone. I have been a lifelong Samsung Galaxy customer and was very excited when I got my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge about a year and a half ago. This phone is a hunk of junk and Samsung is wrong to continue selling it. Do your research (on help forums not websites selling the product) and you will see that there  are a myriad of common problems such as pixel failure, complete screen failure, SD card corruption--the list goes on. My problems began about three months in to having the phone. So much money was spent on it that I'm stuck with it for the foreseeable future. Samsung continues to deny responsibility for these faulty devices and will not send replacements or issue refunds. I bought mine through T-Mobile and because I'd previously had great experiences with Samsung Galaxy products, did not opt-in to purchase the warranty. I took the phone in to an independent electronics service center several months ago and had them replace the screen on the device for $390. This took care of the notorious ""pink line"" these phones get across the screen inditing an impending complete screen failure for about six weeks. The line returned in all it's obnoxious and infuriating glory. Again, I could go on endlessly with other complaints--but trust me you and anyone who glances at your phone won't be able to ignore the screen problem.I will not be buying a Samsung product again.",1.0

123,Amazon,Samsung S8,"I have had my Galaxy S8 for a little bit now and it has been great so far! I love how fast it is. I love the little things about it. The screen is absolutely phenomenal with the curve and screen to body ratio. The fingerprint scanner is great and I know majority don't like the position but for me it works amazing. It fits well in the hand and the cases feel just as nice. Luckily I have not dropped it yet so I hope if I ever do that it withstands the drop that would most likely be out of my pocket or about chest height. Switching from a Galaxy S5 to this S8 was a big change for me and I am glad I made it. Anyone who is thinking about getting this phone, I would say do it. It has everything you could want and more. I was torn between this and the Pixel 2 and they both have almost the same internal hardware but this has a 3.5mm headphone jack. You can't beat that because most companies are now doing away with it. I love not being able to plug in a dongle if I want to quickly listen to music or watch a short video.

124,Amazon,Samsung S8,"This is quite a phone.It's extremely fast compared to our older Samsung S4.It's unlocked, so even when the kind folks at Verizon looked at me as if I was ignorant and gullible as they wondered out loud if the phone would work on the Verizon network, I knew it would (having read the reviews at Amazon) and I just told them to produce the free small sims card.  (Sorry about the lost commission guys, not.)If one already has a Samsung, it works in a similar fashion and a couple of days messing around with it is enough to gain a reasonably good working knowledge of the phone.  The Samsung site is quite informative and I've referred to it several times already.One strange thing is what feels like dueling systems on the phone.

This phone is amazing. It definitely beats out its Apple competitors and if you do not believe me then do your research because this phone is unprecedented. I LOVE it and it is worth every last penny! It will last for years to come and it is built to resist shatters and drops and it is even water resistant for up to 30 minutes under 5 feet of water!!! It is smooth to the touch and is extremely fast!! The memory usage is fantastic and the features it comes with are great.

126,Amazon,Samsung S8,"If you consider purchasing Galaxy S7, S8, or Note 8 then you should read this review first. You may have heard from YouTubers that this is the best android device or the best they have ever used or best display on the market. Some of it is true, but there is more things that the YouTube reviewers don't discuss on their channel. Samsung is really slow when it comes down to pushing newer security updates and even slower pushing newer version of Android. The most important is constantly getting security updates, there are two major bugs that recently shake the smartphone industry, ""KRACK (Wi-Fi Bug)"" & ""BLUEBORNE (Bluetooth Bug)"" every single devices were affected including Apple devices. That said, Google (Nexus and Pixel) and Apple already patched their respective devices, but Samsung is still behind and that leaves vulnerable to hack. May be, you own a business and getting a device to run your business and would carry all the important documents, bank information, or any business related information, your information is at risk.Samsung has come a long way from their Galaxy S4 and Note 3 days, their software is much better now, but it is no where near close to Google's Pure Android that is currently being used on Nexus and Pixel. Samsung Experience/Touchwiz is bloated with unnecessary features and apps that runs in the background and eats up the battery. I have seen much better software experience on Google Pixel, and some other devices from Motorola and Sony. Some people love the Samsung's extra features and use them often, but others don't prefer and want something that is constantly being updated with security measures. There are other issues too related to Samsung Experience (former Touchwiz); I have found various bugs that are not annoying at all, and doesn't hinder day to day use, but they are there. Samsung needs to streamline the experience, and curate it towards what consumers really want and prefer. I do not recommend this device.If you have the device that is working perfectly fine, I suggest you wait it out until next Galaxy or Pixel 3 or get Sony Xperia XZ1. And if your device is broken and need something immediate and wants to spend money, it is entirely up to you.",2.0

129,Amazon,Samsung S8,"For context, in the past three years, I have used a Samsung Galaxy S5 and an LG G5 for my personal line, and an iphone 5s for my work line.  I have been using the S8 for a little while now and it's a mix of upgrades and downgrades from my previous phones.  Before I go into my review, I would like to point out that this review is for the second S8 phone that I got.  The first one (which I ordered from samsung.com) arrived defective, where a dime-sized portion of the touch screen was completely unresponsive out of the box.  While I'm sure every phone manufacturer will ship some defective devices, this has definitely lowered my confidence in Samsung's quality control.  Also, the Samsung customer support is the worst I've ever dealt with, and I spent 9 phone calls and over 13 hours trying to get the issue resolved.  If you do buy the device, buy from a third party (amazon, best buy, verizon, - just not samsung's online store) Here is my review of my second (non-defective) s8 device:1. The screen - First the good: It gets relatively bright outdoors, and is a high quality screen.  Now the bad:  The curve of the screen is the worst feature of the phone.  Sure, it makes the phone look fancy, but it actually makes the phone functionally worse.  When watching full screen videos, you will always have a  distracting glare on the curved edges of the screen.  This effectively means that every movie you watch in landscape mode will have the top and bottom of the movie distorted and annoying to watch.  Second, I have occasionally accidentally activated the back button with my hand when reaching over to the far edge of the screen, and this is definitely because the curve of the screen allows this.  The curve also makes it more difficult to get a glass screen protector that will make full contact with the screen.  And when you do find one, you'll still end up with a non-contact spot if you dont install it precisely in the right spot.  (I wasted a screen protector trying to find the right position.)2 - Performance - The performance of the phone is pretty great.  I haven't had any hiccups and everything seems to be running smoothly.3 - Battery Life - So far the battery is better than any of the phones I have previously had.  It gets me through the day with roughly 45% left at the end of the day.  That's from 7:30am to around 11pm.  I'd estimate I probably use around 4 to 5 hours of screen-on time during a full day.  I really dont like that the battery is not user-replaceable, but that's the world we live in now.  Based on how batteries degrade over time,  I suspect that a year from now, the battery life will not be as good as it is now, and I will have no way to replace it on my own.4 - Cameras - The front and back cameras work well.  I do miss the dual back camera that my LG G5 had, because once in a while a wide angle shot would have been useful.  If you have never used a dual back camera before, you obviously wont miss it.  But if you have, you might be in the same boat wishing that samsung had included it.5 - Fingerprint scanner - The offset location of the fingerprint scanner is odd.  If you use the phone without a case on it, this will probably annoy you as locating it by feel is not super easy.  I always have a case on it though, and this solves the problem.  With the case on it, my finger is immediately  able to find the edge of the cutout in the case, landing it directly on the scanner.  As long as your finger lands on it, the fingerprint scanner is actually quite responsive.6. Bixby - I have only used the voice assistant bixby a few times, so these are only my initial impressions.  I have used Bixby pretty successfully using voice commands to have it read and send text messages without me having to look at or touch the phone.  This is better than my experience with google now.  The bixby button is annoyingly easy to accidentally press though.  It hasn't been a consistent issue for me yet, but if my fingers dont learn to avoid it, I may start looking to see if there are any workarounds to remap or disable the button.7 - Build and design quality - This is where all of the professional review sites have gotten it wrong.  Most of the review sites praise this phone for ""feeling premium"" and having a great design. I'm sorry to say but they clearly have no understanding of what premium build quality is.  If they mean it feels like solid glass, yeah it does, because it is.  Both the front and back are glass.  Sure my fingers feel the glass too, but solid and smooth doesn't mean premium.  What my brain knows when it's holding glass is that it's holding something fragile.  I'm an engineer, and this is how I would design a phone if I wanted it to shatter in a drop.  The curved screen makes it worse, as it's significantly more likely that an impact will occur against the glass.  Also, because of the curve, there are no phone cases that will wrap around the sides of the phone.  This means even with a case there is a good chance you will damage your phone if you drop it.  If you buy this phone, you should probably also get a accidental damage warranty, and expect to pay something like a $100 deductible on top of that if/when you drop the phone.  I hope this design fad goes away, because I would much prefer a phone with a flat screen and an aluminum or plastic back.8 - Water Resistance - The phone is supposed to be water resistant, but honestly I didn't have the guts to check, so I'll have to take their word for it.Overall - This is a mix of good and bad features.  The problem is, there aren't that many device options for a Verizon user who prefers android.  I would have gone with the LG G6, but after the build quality and GPS issues that I (and many other people, apparently) experienced with the G5, I dont really want to buy another LG phone.  The Moto Z2 series looks good, and I'd love to have a phone I don't have to be concerned about dropping, but the phone is bigger than I'd like.  The S8 is a nice size.  Given the other options out there, I don't regret my s8 purchase, but I don't love the phone, and I'm not confident that I wouldn't have been happier with the Moto Z2 or G6.",3.0
130,Amazon,Samsung S8,"The phone I received from this Amazon seller is an unlocked Verizon phone.  It may or may not have been ""unlocked by Samsung"", but that claim is certainly misleading as it leads you to believe that you are receiving a generic universal phone.  Verizon is CDMA, the other more common carriers are GSM and they are not compatible, though some phones offer some of the frequencies of both types.  When I put my AT&T sim card in it, it seemed to work, but the display came up with a Verizon welcome page and there was an annoying ""not a Verizon sim card"" error message in the notification tray.  You could force the error to go away, but it always came back when you powered up the phone.  I did not trust that I would get true GSM performance out of a Verizon phone and might experience slow or degraded performance due to a shortage of available frequencies so I returned the phone and ordered a true unlocked generic phone directly from Samsung.  It cost more but the peace of mind is worth it.  For over $700 including tax you shouldn't have to put up with nuisance messages in your new phone, potentially degraded performance or deceptive advertising.1/11/2018 -  Received my new phone that I ordered from directly from Samsung today.  It is a true generic phone without any carrier software installed and very streamlined.  Now that I have seen what a new phone should look like I can also add to my original review that the phone I received from ""Electronic Deals"" via Amazon was NOT a new phone, or had at least been previously opened because it was missing a few of the accessories were included with the phone I received today and it also had fingerprints all over it. I recommend paying the extra $75 and getting a truly new phone that is universal directly from the Samsung store.",2.0
131,Amazon,Samsung S8,"So many other reviewers have posted exemplary write-ups detailing the features, benefits, photos of the S8.  I won't even try to compare. All I can tell you is that I needed to replace my 3-year-old Galaxy Alpha, so when the Galaxy S8 went on sale over Labor Day weekend, I walked into a big box retailer (whose name rhymes with ""guest guy"") intending to buy one of the lesser priced prior year models like the G7. However when I walked into the display area, the S8 winked at me, it was love at first sight, I was stunned and floored by the beauty, grace, forward-looking design, advanced features including VR, and vibration control video camera performance that reminded me (in my simplistic estimation) of Hollywood steadicam, a far cry from my prior Alpha's performance in that regard.  (Plus, simply, when it comes to Android, where obsolescence unfortunately happens rather quickly, newer is better, because it gives you longer usable life.)  I bought.  I haven't looked back.  The two of us have been joined at the hip (literally) for almost 2 months, as I mated it with a very inexpensive, minimal size holster case that visually recedes out of the way to allow the stunning beauty of this phone to shine (while continuing to buffer it from shocks).Phone setup was a breeze, as I merely unplugged the micro SIM from my Galaxy Alpha, plugged it into the S8, and my cellular carrier was auto-configured by the S8, so you really can't hope for anything cleaner than that. Plus the simplified migration utility that came with the S8  copied over my files and photos, my contacts lists and more, from my prior phone.I spent a fair amount of time optimizing app power use.  The S8 now uses minimal power while I'm out and about, and at night it takes no more than a few minutes to bring to full charge again, ready for next day.A chief buying criteria for me was camera performance. I found amazing praise in the comparative reviews published at GSMArena, a prominent factor in my willingness to purchase the S8.  Camera performance matches or exceeds reviewers' expectations.Unlock methods:  fingerprint / face scan / iris scan / voice scan / nearby device detection / draw pattern / type a PIN.  (I've used face, fingerprint, pattern.)  Fingerprint wasn't working for a while but Samsung fixed with a firmware push (Nov 2018).I'm a guy who has consciously avoided the phablet phenomenon as I can't imagine carrying a massive hunk of hardware wherever I go. The S8 has surprised me with its incredibly large viewable area, while still maintaining a manageably slim and narrow carrying profile, the perfect fusion of function, beauty and utility, in my opinion.Read some of the other reviews, see it for yourself, and allow yourself to believe that there truly can be such an exceptional piece of engineering.So far, it's been a joy ride.",5.0
132,Amazon,Samsung S8,Listen to me right now when I say the S8 is a good phone. Holy crap its amazing super fast HD display this phone is beautiful! Mobile Internation LLC is a trustable place to buy your S8 look at the seller he sells new S8's with no lies or gimmicks.

133,Amazon,Samsung S8,"This is a great phone in terms of its power and UI... Pretty much any phone in this price point is going to be amazing, and it definitely fits the bill in terms of specs and performance.However, it is probably the most fragile phone ever made.  I have never broken a phone in my life, and I drop my phone as much as the next person.  You can tell the second you hold this phone that it is amazingly fragile.  The whole thing is made of Gorilla glass, which is known to spider crack extremely easily.  Crazy that this design was actually approved, I don't care how strong you think your glass is it will never be more durable than metal/plastic.  Any benefits are overshadowed by the fact this is the most fragile phone ever to hit the market.The design of the phone makes it way easier for it to slip out of your pocket.  I can't ever remember having my phone fall out of my pocket (I am sure it has happened, but nothing became of it IE breaks), but I had to constantly be aware of my phone in my pocket/take it out and put it on the table because when I sat it immediately started to slip out.  I think it is because this phone is larger vertically and smaller horizontally compared to most phones.  I have owned many phones, and this has never been a problem until the moment I put this phone in my pocket.My phone fell out of my pocket while sitting, it was a drop between 2 and 2.5 feet, and it cracked in 2 corners, one corner that was not even apart of the initial impact.  The fact a corner that had no major impact whatsoever (a fall of maybe 4 inches after the first corning hit the ground) cracked was alarming to say the least.  Shame on me for not having the case on it (I literally had the phone for 3 hours, did not make it home yet and my case I purchased was at home)...  However, few weeks later it slipped out again, with a case on, and the whole front of the phone shattered.... Again a drop no more than 2.5 feet.Insurance on this phone is an absolutely must, or I guarantee you will not own this phone in a working fashion very long.  My S5 fell 2 stories and didn't get a scratch. This phone fell 2 feet and spider cracked to a point where I need to get it repaired.  One of the most important aspects of a cell phone is its durability and ability to handle everyday life and people where accidents happen at one point or another is guaranteed.  The fact you have to treat this phone with the delicacy of an infant makes it almost a burden to own.Between the failings of the S7 and the beyond poor durability of the S8, this lifelong Android user may switch to Iphone my next phone purchase a few years down the line",2.0

She recently upgraded to the iPhone 7 Plus (Red Special Edition) ... & it's 'nice' ... but when I received my new Galaxy S8+, I was instantaneously reminded of the style, quality & excellence that only Samsung can deliver.  It's not even close.* FYI ... I purchased a Verizon Prepaid SIM Card, as a suggested add-on through Amazon after adding the phone to my Cart.  The Verizon SIM Card is a 'Verizon Wireless SIM Kit Prepaid Sim Card - (Moto G & Any Verizon Branded Phone)'.  When I attempted to activate the phone w/ SIM Card through the Verizon Wireless website, the activation would not complete & Verizon claimed I needed a 'Samsung' SIM Car Kit.

The lady that was on the phone got mine to work with in 10-15 mins.So if you are worried that this might not work with Verizon, don't be scared. It works.

136,Amazon,Samsung S8,"After using an old phone with such a large bezel, the switch to the Galaxy S8 was spectacular. I could not stop staring at the screen when I first saw it. There is just so much of it! After using this phone for a couple months, I have created a list of what i love the most and dislike the most of this product.Pros:-Screen has amazing brightness, resolution and size.-Cameras are spectacular. Images are sharp and crisp.-Opposed to contrary belief, the fingerprint scanner on the back is easy to reach and is very responsive-Battery life is very good, also charges very quickly with the included Fast Charger-Has Video Enhancement and Game Enhancement modes for when you need extra brightness, performance and screen resolution.Cons:-Feels very delicate (easily solved with a case)-Glass on the back so it is a fingerprint magnet (easily solved with a case)-Bixby Button can be confused as Volume Down button, also Bixby software is not the best at the moment but it is a new product and has lots of potential.Overall great phone and great experience so far. Would Recommend!",5.0
137,Amazon,Samsung S8,"I can't say anything bad about this phone. My Nexus 5x died on me and I had to find a replacement. There was a lot of, ""Wait for the new pixel phone"" talk going around my friend circle, but the S8 just looked really good! And, so far, its been a great experience! The phone is light, sleek, feels good in hand, feels good in pocket, is more sturdy than I had thought, is fast, great photos, great interface and has an expandable SD slot (which my nexus didn't have, so, improvement).The biggest caveat I've had so far is the Bixby button. I'm glad that Samsung has added a ""disable"" feature, but remapping that button would be great. Beyond that, love the phone :)",5.0

I've tried to delete the same picture 6 times now and it keeps showing up when I go back to my gallery.-Everyday I have at least one update of a new glitch, flaw, or problem with this phone.... this is my most updated review because of how terrible this phone is.-New text message notifications do not go away. I've opened the message twice and closed it and it's still telling me the message is new...-Received a notification today that I've never seen before. The app ""SYSTEM"" was causing problems and needed to be closed... don't I need the system app?-Power button does not function, it takes at least 2-3 presses to get it to recognize the press.-Screen was heavily tinted red right out of the box, I needed to adjust the color settings to turn the red completely off.-""Person is typing..."" text box is right on top of the most recent text so you cannot read it.-FINALLY, they gave an option to disable the Bixby button, now I just have a completely useless button on my phone. Maybe it could be remapped to be a fully functional power button since my phone doesn't have one?-Pictures sent via text message take 5+ minutes to send, fail, and then resend in a minute.-Battery life is getting worse with every update, I used to be able to use my phone over a 48 hour period without charging. Now I have to charge it every 24 hours or less.-Automatic brightness that adjusts to your patterns is a nice feature. However, in sunlight it defaults to max brightness and you cannot change it. Compared to the S7 this phone is nowhere near as bright. I frequently have problems seeing the screen at max brightness, blacks blend together and any dark movies are unwatchable.-Audio is acceptable, you can't expect much from a single speaker on the bottom right of the phone... Volume levels are poor. Any background noise beyond a fan will make it difficult if not impossible to hear dialogue in a movie at max volume.-Auto rotate works when it wants to, never when you want it to.-Word prediction and swyping on this phone is as bad if not worse than previous Galaxy models. I think it is worse because I'm getting strings of letters that are not even English. I never lift my finger off, and swipe very common words, and end up with gibberish. Some examples: planning changes to pls no do, sending changes to section, doing changes to don, what changes to Wyatt, checking to cur king, stay to starry, anything to abutting, constantly to com subtly, maybe to mary be, keep to Leo, on to oob, something to sobering, today to fist, someone to sombrero get...",1.0
139,Amazon,Samsung S8,"I will simply add to the ""I love it"" category but I do want to add something that might not be known. Samsung is a bit deceptive in their advertising of this phone. The infinity display is NOT really infinity. Notice they overexpose the edges on the image shown for this product. This is to hide the fact that the display does not really go from edge to edge. It goes over the curve slightly but there is a noticeable edge around the display. It is not technically an Infinity display. That's a bit of a letdown, but not a game changer for me in saying I still love the phone. Mostly because the camera is great and the battery is sick, that is awesome.",5.0
140,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Long time iPhone user that was moved to try the Galaxy S8+ due to its large screen, beautiful design, and deep price discounts. Unfortunately, I had to return the S8+ after just a week and a half because it was unable to maintain a band 12 T-Mobile LTE connection. T-Mobile blamed Samsung, Samsung blamed T-Mobile, so I just returned the thing. I went back to my iPhone 7+ ready to put the whole S8+ experience down as a failed experiment. I originally ordered the S8+ from Samsung's website. The user experience of the purchase and return, compared to Apple, was crude and confusing. I had to call Samsung order support and tech support multiple times, every interaction with Samsung was awful. Everything I was told by support was wrong and they never followed through with anything they said they would do.But here's the thing, as I went back to using my iPhone 7+, iOS just felt so... boring. And the iPhone 7+ design, which I had previously liked, looked so... dated.Now let's face it, Android is a mess. Duplicated functionality, inconsistent UX, and the Android upgrade and update situation is pathetic. But Android felt exciting! And boy do I miss that S8 screen and overall phone design.Then there is this year's Apple contenders. Sure, Apple hasn’t announced anything yet, but with all the leaks we pretty much know that two of the iPhones will continue the tired 3-year old iPhone 6 design, and the new AMOLED iPhone with that ugly notch?Have you seen the leaks of the Galaxy Note 8? What a stunner!I'll wait for Apple to officially announce, but if the leaks and rumors end up being true - call me a glutton for punishment - I’m all over that Galaxy Note 8!Update: 9/19/17 - now that the iPhone X has been announced and the Note 8 is available, I bought another S8+, and this one is functioning just fine. I don't like the iPhone X's look (the notch), the price, and many of its new features aren’t things I would ever use. I didn' see enough bang for the additional bucks to choose the Note 8 over the S8+.  With the Galaxy S8+, I think I have the best looking phone on the market today at a reasonable price (got it on sale), even if I have to put up with Android's goofiness.",4.0
141,Amazon,Samsung S8,"I didn't think much of this phone as I was waiting for the Note 8. (Was a Note 4 user just 2 days before) But as the Note 8 became more disappointing with each leak, and esspecially after it's release with no embedded fingerprint scanner and a smaller battery than the S8+, I decided to look at the S8+. It was cheaper, has the same features as the Note 8 and, I believe it's safe to say, a better battery life. It was clear that this phone was next on the throne. While I wouldn't have the pen, I had to admit to myself that I hardly used the pen for the Note 4 anyway. No real loss there, so I ended up saving myself a few hundred bucks.As for the phone itself, I am very impressed. The display is so beautiful- especially with the infinity display. Textures look almost too real and the colors are so sharp and eye pleasing. Even in videos. I was also impressed with the battery life. Throughout the day I used the Note 4 and S8+ fairly equally and to my surprise, from 9am to 3pm the S8+ left me with 70% from 100% while my Note 4 had to be charged again from 100%.Customization is a must for me with any phone and this phone has outdone my expectation for any phone. Of course it has the basic customizations, but this phone goes so deep into it that I still haven't been able to see all that you can do with it after 2 days of use when I usually go through everything on a phone within a day.No phone is perfect and there's usually at least one thing I won't like about a phone. The ONLY thing I don't like about this phone is the placement of the speaker. It's located at the bottom of the phone in the right side, and that's a problem because I'm a gamer and I occasionally watch YouTube which I preferably use in landscape mode which requires that you turn the phone horizontally. When I hold the phone naturally in that position, I end up covering the speaker which forces me to readjust my grip to a more uncomfortable one.That being said, this phone is still the best one I could have purchased at this time and I do NOT regret buying it whatsoever.",5.0
142,Amazon,Samsung S8,"I was looking for a new Android phone and it came down to this or the Pixel 2. The Pixel 2 doesn't have a headphone jack so I opted for the s8. This is a great phone! I'm sure there are more detailed reviews out there, but overall, I love this phone. Smooth interface, beautiful form factor, headphone jack, no problems using all my apps. I like the unusual screen shape, which is a bit longer than typical, which means you get more screen space without having to deal with a super-wide phone. It does overheat more easily than my earlier Nexus 5 (to be fair, I accidentally took it into a sauna so this is an unusual use case) and there are times when the touch screen isn't quite as responsive as I'd like, but it's a solid phone for the price. I've used multiple apps and functions, hooked it up to Bluetooth speakers and headphones (regular and Bluetooth), connected to multiple WiFi ports, etc. And it's handled all of that pretty comfortably.It's slim and the screen is big so people recommend a case.

143,Amazon,Samsung S8,"This phone is absolutely beautiful to hold and it has a sleek, 'new-car' feeling!Over all the functionality is similarly comparable across the Galaxy phones (4/7edge) with exception to few obvious changes (upgrades?) to the phone.  In the quest for the slick, they opted to take away the 'Home' button, which my fingers - as well as other iPhone/Galaxy users - have gotten subconsciously programmed to press, only to find that there are no buttons. I would need to 'swipe up' from the bottom of the screen and a virtual 'Home’ button, 'back' function and 'multi-window' interface becomes accessible.This phone has a Samsung Note8-esque interface (not to mention, the screen size difference between those two is just 0.1 inch!). So outside of the Stylus, S8+ promises to be just as versatile in its use!  One other function they did away with - because of the ‘Home’ button change - I have to use the Volume down+Power button to take a screenshot.  Using my thumb+middle finger to squeeze a shot may get some getting used to!The 3500mAh Battery holds well through the day (I use it heavily and I only seem to be down to about 35% by dinner time) and the only thing that seems to 'overheat' the product and/or shorten the battery life is when I am using it with VR.When I first had the Samsung S4, I was able to capture image of a beautiful low-light sunset (for which I was selected winner for a photography submission) and ever since then I’ve been HOOKED!  I took a photo of another sunset! This one was taken without any special filter and yet it beautifully captures the layers of the fading colors - S8+ exceeds it’s low-light capabilities of it's predecessors!  In addition, there are some new photo functions (swipe left in ‘Camera’). I love that as an inner (or Yelp) ‘Foodies’, I have my very own food filter to snap as many lunch or dinners as I pleased!  Use the 'Pro' function and I am Wow'd with the filter package it comes with!Getting an unlocked phone will give me the freedom to choose mobile network not just in the US but Internationally - which is great, as an international photographer to travel with and it sure beats carrying around multi handsets!  As an unlocked phone, this Samsung S8+ has both CDMA and GSM capabilities.  I went with a CDMA network, and the company blocked my ‘Talk and Surf’ function. On the bright side, CDMA does seem to preserve the battery life better so it’s a toss up!As the saying goes, ya either will Love it or Hate it, like Kimchee.

146,Amazon,Samsung S8,"I bought this S8 phone directly from Samsung as they were having a big sale just before Thanksgiving, plus they were giving $400 rebates on my old phone (a Samsung S7 I purchased from Verizon).  My old S7 was in great condition, but ... it was locked into Verizon, and despite what their offices will tell you, it's difficult to buy a SIM chip overseas to purchase service in order to avoid Verizon's high cost international plans.  When the phone arrived, I put in a new 64mb memory chip, enabled Wifi, logged into my Gmail account, and almost immediately Google started sending my apps to the new phone.  I spent an hour or two recreating my pages, and then the dreaded moment arrived - time to move the Verizon SIM from the old to the new, and either go online or call Verizon to associate the new S8 with my old SIM/phone number.  But ... amazingly, within 30 seconds of installing the SIM, the S8 became fully operational and was using my phone number!  Easy, peasy.  No logging into Verizon, wading thru their Customer Svc dept - nada.  It just worked!  So, how do I like the new S8?  Well, I could do without the curved glass, and don't like doing without the home button and the quick unlocking of the phone, but ... the battery life seems to be longer, although it's still a bit early.  Am finding that if I'm going to be away from electrical power it's best to disable the biggest battery hog of all time - Facebook.  It doesn't hurt to disable it, as it comes roaring back when you open it, but while in disabled mode it's not constantly polling the Mother Ship and drawing the battery down.  Oh, and the camera seems to be a wash versus the S7.  At some point, and maybe we've reached it - smartphones will have a level of perfection which - for all practical purposes - can't be exceeded.

150,Amazon,Samsung S8,"I had iphone 6+ and changed to the S8. I did not like the over size and weight iphone 6+ and I did not like the small screen size of the iphone 6. The S8 is much smaller and lighter and has a bigger screen which is amazing. The display is way better than iphone 6+ and also is OLED which iphone doesn’t have and maybe the next gen iphone will have on its most expensive model. Pictures and movies look far superior than on the iphone. I needed and unlocked phone so when I travel to other countries I just drop in a sim card from that country and not have to pay roaming charges etc.The S8 supports wireless charging in which I bought an after market wireless charger stand for $16 and works excellent and also can charge while on its side which is nice when watching movies. The screen looks like miniature movie theatre when watching full length movies and most movies fill the entire screen.The memory can expand to 2 TB when available but I just stuck in 128 gig sd card for now. I have lots of FLAC lossless music and it takes up lots of space and also have lots of HD movies. By the way Apple does not support FLAC lossless music which is the most prolific lossless music format available. And also the S8 video is 4k so that takes a lot of memory. You need to up the resolution in settings as the default is not the highest.The benchmarks show that the S8 is twice as fast as the iphone 6+. The battery life seems good but did not have it long enough. Some people say that the battery life is average but with the much higher speed and higher resolution graphics, the tradeoff of slightly less battery life is fine with me. Also the weight factor and size is important to me.It has a built in pulse sensor and O2 sensor which works good and can calculate stress level also.When plugged into my Dell I7 notebook it sees the internal memory and the SD card so easy to load files from the computer. However when plugged into my Acer Aspire I5 desk computer it sees the S8 but not the internal or external memory. Also when using my wifi file transfer app it only can access the internal memory and does not see the external memory.The fingerprint sensor works excellent and after a few times I had no problem putting my finger on the sensor and not accidently on the camera lens. I don’t know why people complain as it is a no brainer after a few times only. I find the fingerprint sensor to be very fast and 100% accurate. However I use the retina sensor to unlock the phone and works excellent also and very fast and 100% accurate so I don’t use the fingerprint sensor unless I have to.I do not know how the new iphone 8 will compare of course but with the new iphone OS 11 you won’t be able to run any 32 bit programs so many programs will not work after the upgrade. The S8 also retains the headphone jack which is important to me and apple got rid of it of course forcing you to use and adapter. The S8 uses the  C type usb connector which is much better and more robust than the micro usb that most phones come with and now appears to be the industry standard for portable devices.The phone is also waterproof to a certain extent but I did not test it and not sure how water will not get into the headphone jack. The earphones that come with the phone are throw away type but maybe ok for phone call and with good earphone and or headphone the sound is excellent with FLAC lossless music.I like the fact that I can open multiple windows and switch back and forth quickly which Apple OS can’t do and also there is always a back button which somehow Apple feels is not necessary so going back to a previous page etc. is impossible unless the app itself contains a back button. It is also easier to add items in groups than the Apple OS. Lots of other features makes this phone easier to use and manage than the Apple OS.As soon as you get this phone you need to buy a case and a good screen protector obviously due to the front and back being glass. The case would make the size a little bigger but not as big and cumbersome as the 6+.I have not used the Bixby and the left Bixby button should be user programmable so the user has control as to what you want it to do. There are other options to use other than Bixby of course.To conclude, there is no perfect phone but this has the fewest problems of the phones I’ve encountered up until now and I bought this on sale making the price much cheaper than the comparable iphone also.",5.0

152,Amazon,Samsung S8,"I can not say enough about this phone. It is as perfect as a company has done creating the perfect smartphone for me.This phone is PERFECT in my hand. Its screen is big but you wouldn't be able to tell because it is in such a small footprint. The phone is light. The worst thing about the design is how slippery it is. But a skin or case will fix that.The bezelless display makes it look leagues above every phone out there other then the Pixel 2, Essential Phone, iPhone X and LG V30. To me however the iPhone X and the S8 are tied aesthetically. They both represent the next generations of what is a smartphone. I almost bought a LG G6 before I even held this phone and thank god I didn't buy it. It doesn't compare aesthetically at all. I can list many reasons why this phone is better then all phones other then the Note 8. The V30 is debatable. And the iPhone X isn't available to the masses yet.The screen is AMAZING. Which everyone knows Sammy Mobile creates the best screens around. However, I came from a Note 5 to this thing and could instantly see the difference. Which is crazy because I didn't think the screen could get any better at a QHD resolution (this screen is only QHD+ because of the 16:9 aspect ratio).At first I thought I would hate the aspect ratio. I love squarish phones so much and prefer my displays to be more square then rectangle. But I actually got used to it fast. Content on this looks so good with that aspect ratio. Youtube, Netflix, Amazon Video and the native Samsung video app all support a zoom in function. At first I was thinking this would be terrible because it would look stretched and things would be missing I needed to see. But no. They did an AMAZING job with the zoom feature. It's the reason I was finally sold on this aspect ratio. With out it I would have never gotten this phone.The cameras are amazing. The pixel is the only one that compares. Even the iPhone X looks night and day compared to this phone. It may be preference but shots from this phone are so much better imo.I waited a month before I wrote this review to see if the phone would start slowing down or stuttering. Nope! I run a launcher and a custom notification shader and my phone doesn't even seemed bothered. My Note 5 slowed down and sputtered when I customized the heck out of it. My S8+? No problem.The fingerprint scanner, iris scanner and facial recognition are all amazing. I have used them all and had no problems. Yes photos can trick facial recognition. However I am way more worried about a stranger robbing me or stealing it then I am of someone I know taking it. So facial recognition to me, has gotten a bad rep on this phone. As well as the fingerprint scanner. I pull out my phone conveniently with my finger in the same spot as the fingerprint scanner. So to me this design works. When I am using it two handed I just slide my left hand up and it really isn't that bad. But it is the biggest complaint on this phone. That says A LOT!Battery life has been phenomenal. I crank it to max brightness. Wifi is usually on, NFC and bluetooth. I am still averaging like 4-5 1/2 screen on time.With a bezelless gorgeous 2K HDR screen, 4 gb Ram, Samsung Pay, the cameras, the security features (Samsung Knox, Pass, Secure Folder and the various biometric locks ), the light skin over Android, the specs that future proof it (LTE-A/LTE+, Bluetooth 5.0), big battery with great longevity (battery cycle count a lot higher then all phones before it) and wireless charging, HEADPHONE Jack, exedra exedra this is as perfect as a cell phone as you can get imo. Front facing stereo speakers are the only missing feature I can think of. But even then the speaker on this is really nice.As you can tell I love this phone. Probably my favorite peice of tech since I got my iPad Pro 9.7. Definitely by this. If you don't get a V30, Note 8 or iPhone X instead if that's your thing.Easiest 5/5 rating I have ever given.",5.0
153,Amazon,Samsung S8,"I have 2 of these, one for me and one for my girlfriend.  They both are flawless in performance and features.  I see some reviews complain on here about features that can be easily disabled.... which makes no sense... one if you dont like a feature it can be disabled ( bixby, always on display)  but why pay $500+ for a phone to not get the most out of it.Pros:1. Battery life is amazing, i can have this game playing a game for hours with brightness and graphics all the way up and then look at my battery life, and it still be 50%2. charge time is better, with the provided charger, and pugin  it takes less than 2 hours to charge 0-75%.3. Bixby... although many dislike her, this is the best attempted AI ever provided.  It learns what apps i use and what times i sleep. always watching but a Great mobile AI... want to say the first I believe. (yeah siri isn't AI, it doesn't learn based on past inputs as bixby does.)",5.0
154,Amazon,Samsung S8,"The Samsung Galaxy S8+ is one of the largest phones in the market yet it is hard to believe how slim it is. The Infinity Display makes for a huge beautiful screen, which is great for multi-tasking, watching videos and editing pictures, without the distraction of buttons. The size can be a drawback as it is hard to use only one hand unless you activate the one-handed mode. The increased battery size gets me through the day, better than previous models. Having used the fingerprint authentication on my phone for several years, I was a bit disappointed in the placement of the S8’s scanner. It is hard to reach, requires me to pick up my phone and I keep smudging my camera. However, I switched over to the iris scanner and it is amazingly fast. I wear glasses and it has worked with them in various lighting conditions with only an occasional adjustment. Some additional features are included with the camera, such as masks and stickers, similar to other social photo apps, and one unique feature is using Bixby search. Though it is not 100% accurate, it does a decent job of finding similar objects just by the picture. It is actually kind of humorous to see what other things it comes up with, like my buddies dog was identified as a Labrador retriever, horse and cattle. He does seem as big as a horse or cow though. Bixby is an interesting feature that is Samsung’s attempt at competing with Apple’s Siri and improving on their own S-Voice. With the dedicated button you can avoid the usual opening commands of “Hey …” or “OK …” and go straight into what you need. You can still use the voice command of “Hi Bixby” to get things done if you choose to, but I prefer to just hold the button and start dictating. Bixby does all of the usual commands to help you easily send messages, place calls, set timers and reminders. You can also get Samsung Reward points by using Bixby and gaining experience points. This includes just playing around with Bixby and asking some ridiculous questions like “rap for me.” In return your earned points can get you gift cards or chances to win prizes. Bixby will also read off the time, weather and news highlights aloud for your alarms, a nice touch when waking up in the morning.",5.0
155,Amazon,Samsung S8,"I was expecting something amazing after upgrading from my old Note 4, and this falls short of my expectations. Battery life is disappointing, even with most of the apps ""sleeping"". It's the one thing that needs to be addressed and fixed - a larger battery cell on a phone this big is probably something that most consumers would be OK with. I also don't really like the absence of a ""home"" button, and the Bixby button on the left side of the phone is RIDICULOUS. You think you're pressing the volume button, and instead you get the Bixby screen pop up. I've yet to use it - Google Assistant works like a charm on this phone and wakes up with ""OK Google"".On the plus side, this phone qualifies for Sprint's 1 year free unlimited bring your own phone plan.",4.0
156,Amazon,Samsung S8,"I found the opportunity to test the Galaxy S8+ fully expecting to have mediocre reactions to it. After a few weeks, I can confidently say this phone is pretty damn good.The biggest issue I had with samsung phones is the cumbersome overlay and bloatware that seemed to bring the phone to a grinding halt. My previous experience with the Note 4 wasn't lost on me. It worked well at first but lag made it a chore to use. It's only been a few weeks but I've noticed no lag. Apps open zippily; the camera is quick to use. No longer does it seem like there are a million useless apps to clog things up. The new Touchwiz interface seems much more sleek and the Samsung software actually useful. Whichever apps you don't like, you can simply disable. In fact, I find notifications that the phone has disabled unused apps running in the background very reassuring.The display is beautiful. Stunning image quality. I love watching videos on it. Yes, samsung tends to oversaturate images but you can choose to turn this down. Blue light display helps at night to reduce strain on my eyes. Edge-to-edge infinity screen with minimal bezels makes this a beauty to look at, and I receive many compliments on it.Picture quality is great on the camera. Low-light is OK, but day-and-night over my previous iPhone 6. I miss the dual-lens available on the Note 8, but for a single lens, this is great.Battery life is excellent. I use it pretty heavily for music, chat and web browsing through the day and I never run low. If I need a charge, fast-charge gives me a lot of juice with just 10-15 minutes plugged in.Cons:Bixby isn't great. It doesn't seem to wake up half the time with voice commands. While it's not necessarily bad, it offers no real advantages in my daily use to Google Assistant, which conveniently is also available on this device.Fingerprint scanner. Takes getting used to but with a case, is much more easy to find. Not a deal-breaker by any means.Speaker is terrible. There's a single speaker at the bottom of the phone which is easy to accidentally cover up. I use headphones most of the time, however, and as this is now one of the few phones that still has a headphone jack, is no problem.This is by far the best phone I've had, and I'm glad I went with this over the iPhone X which is going for nearly double the price.",5.0
157,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Had the S7 Edge and loved it. S8 plus? home button. Or should I say lack of a home button. Now it's on the screen and way to easy to touch.  Once again in an attempt to make something great even better they screwed part of it up. The screen chips extremely easy, even with protector. Got my S8 Plus at Best Buy, they recomended the screen protector, installed it and said its bullet proof now. 1 drop from about 18 inches. Screen protector shattered and fell off plus chipped the screen. Best buys response. Not our problem.  Would be an excellent phone if not for the home button and extremely brittle screen.",1.0
158,Amazon,Samsung S8,"I like the phone in general its an amazingly dense piece of technology.  One feature in particular I was looking for was barometric altimeter and that works well in this phone.  Ride with GPS app can keep accurate topography on my rides.  I have no interest in adopting another voice assistant in my life though, so the bixby stuff is kind of annoying.  I removed the button actuator from my case because it was being pressed when I took the phone from my pocket or just whenever I picked it up to do something else.  The bicycle mount that I use with it also would press that button.  The moto X touch free voice assistant is superior to the button.I'm not sure that the curved screen adds real utility for me.  its cool but I  think I'd prefer the phone to be flat so that a simple glass protector can be used even if that makes the phone a couple of mm wider.The VR viewer device works really nice with this phone and its hi res screen, and the battery life is considerably better than what I was used to with MotoX phones.  Although the curved screen is kinda cool, it makes using a conventional glass protective cover impossible, and I have now shattered my phone after 4 weeks and this is a really expensive screen to fix.  I'm having a little buyers remorse right now.  Turns out that since I am inside the 90 day warranty, samsung will repair it for about $206 wihich is cheaper than buying a kit on Ebay.  Packing it up to send away for that tomorrow.  5 - 7 business day estimated turn around.  The S8 Active is interesting but more than 2X the price.  Given my usage profile, bulkier and more durable would be an acceptable trade off.Update on the repair:  it went smooth, I was billed as expected and got the phone back in a few days.  THEN I drove off from home with the phone on the roof one day and a neighbor returned it to me in tact.  Just a tiny scratch on one corner of the front glass.Full disclosure, I did drop this phone several times before the killer drop which was a stupid situation where I was holding it over my head to get wifi signal over a barrier..  Given that it is front and back glass, its not as fragile as you might think.  Still, its glass, so dropping it on a rock doesn't end well and the direct bonded OLED + touch + 3D glass assembly is not cheap to replace when it happens.",4.0
159,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Excellent hardware but the Samsung software could have been written better by a sophomore computer science major.The Samsung Bloatware should be uninstallable by the end user. This is my first Samsung phone and probably my last. I bought two because after being an Android purist with Nexus and HTC devices, I figured I would give them a try. I am really disappointed with the Galaxy Software and store. I love Google photos but the camera app keeps forcing the Samsung app on me. I gave it a two star for the software and lack of ability to uninstall most of it. You can disable some apps but they are usually back at reboot. Even with all of my Google app store credits from survey rewards, this will probably push me over the edge to go to iPhone. Samsung, please get your crap together and fix this software abomination.",2.0
160,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Hardware is top notch. The phone is impressively powerful and the beautiful screen makes using it a joy. Music fans will love the SD card support and 3.5mm jack.

161,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Definitely a noticeable improvement in speed from the S7; it seems snappier. Losing the physical home key and moving the fingerprint sensor to the back near the camera lens was a little annoying at first, but I got used to it fairly quickly. Even though the physical home key is gone, there is still a satisfying tactile ""click"" for feedback if you press down on the location of the home key. You also can lightly touch the home key and it will respond, like the back and menu keys.The size is nice. The screen is narrow enough that I can reach across the entire screen with my smaller hands, and it is tall/long enough to allow more of a webpage to be read on the screen at one time.Bixby seems like another S voice knockoff that doesn't quite do things as well as Google Voice. There are some youtube videos showing cool tricks you can do with Bixby that can't be done with the other voice apps, but they seem like tricks rather than useful tools. I ended up disabling Bixby, and there are some low-cost apps available to help you do that. The placement of the Bixby button so close to the volume buttons actually ends up with a lot of accidental Bixby pop-ups when you are trying to adjust the volume.The camera is awesome. It starts up quickly and the autofocus is fast. There is plenty of on-board memory for photos and video. One somewhat hidden feature in the Edge is the Animation portion of the Smart Select. You can select an area of the screen while a video is playing and create a GIF. Perfect for making a reaction GIF.",4.0
162,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Pretty good looking and impressive phone. I definitely like it much better than the iPhone 6 that I had. I've had it for 2 1/2 months and so far so good. But Samsung is notorious for their phones doing good for the first 6 months and then crapping out because of their software updates. We'll see. I did go for the Sprint 12 month Forever Galaxy Plan so I don't have to wait every two years to upgrade.The interface is much more intuitive than the iPhone 6. Gorgeous 5.8"" edge to edge Infinity screen. I like how you can crop the screen on YouTube videos. They do need to patch the software to allow users to keep that feature on at all times. Annoying not having that option. Great speakerphone. Loud and clear!Overall, probably the best smartphone on the market right now. As of this post, Apple just announced their new iPhone X. I remember when Samsung was playing catch-up with Apple, now it's the opposite. The iPhone X seems like a copy of the GS8. Front and back glass. 5.8"" curved screen. Probably the same 18.5 by 9.0 ratio screen as well. I don't think most people care for those fat and wide phones, I know I don't. The GS8 is narrow and comfortable in your hand, still sporting a huge screen size for a smartphone.I was watching Fox News when the iPhone X was announced and these people, who by the way all seem to be on the Apple bandwagon, were cheerfully saying and bragging about the X's face recognition, like this was some new technology. The GS8 already has that going back to the Note 7, as well as having iris scanning which the X doesn't have.Did anyone see that jerk CEO Tim Cook brag about the X's feature of their interactive emoticons, using a pile of crap with a funny face? What class! Apple can keep their NSA iPhone X! I know I know, we have the same problem with Google Android phones as well. Oh well, what can we do? I need my smartphone for work. :-(",5.0
163,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Wife recently purchased thru ATT authorized store. She loved the look and feel of the 8+ and at first, it worked great. However, within a few days it stopped working, displaying no network available error code on screen. Problem is, we were at home and my phone, an older Samsung S4 Active, also with ATT was working so there definitely was ATT network service available. Turned the phone on and off a few times, still no signal. Finally, using my phone, called ATT customer service. Forty five mins later with numerous instructions from ATT Agt, using my phone, finally managed to get her phone up and running with Agt stating he had found an error on the part of the store sales clerks initial registration process. Ok, fine. Fast forward 3-4 days later, same problem + phone was shutting itself off for no reason. Back to customer service using her phone this time. It would not allow her to make any outside phone calls or text messages, giving same no network available error code, yet it would allow her to dial customer service using 611, however. Another long conversation with ATT phone rep again who, this time suggested taking phone back to store and have the sim card replaced. Phone was now 16 days old since purchase. Did exactly that and store clerk changed out sim card. Still didn't work. Tried 2nd sim card on same visit and it didn't work either.  Store clerk then erased electronic serial number in their system, re-typed same ser # back in, reinserted 2nd sim card, rebooted phone and it finally worked but only for about 4 days before same problem occurred again. Problem is, she had to go out of town to a funeral and needed a dependable phone. She was so frustrated by now, she had ATT store switch sim card back over to her old iphone 5, which at least had always been dependable, if not very exciting. Thus she was safe on the trip, at least as far as having a phone she could count on again. When she returned home from funeral a few days later, she immediately called ATT customer service, once again explaining her problem. Another 30 min conversation and they now wanted to send her a refurbished phone replacement for a phone she was paying a new phone charge for, not a refurb price. She refused the refurb and the ATT rep finally told her he was making note in file, recommending the selling ATT store take it back. She also called Samsung directly and their rep told her to take it back to store and have them do a factory reset before sending it in to Samsung for warranty repair. Samsung rep was sure that would more than likely fix the problem. So she took the S8+ phone back to ATT store where she bought it, demanding a new phone, since they couldn't seem to fix it. They refused and in stead, sent her sixty miles down the road to an Atlanta Corporate ATT store, the Mgr of the selling store stating he was sure the Corporate store would replace it, what with the ATT phone rep recommending same. Corporate store mgr. was indignant, rude and emphatically refused, stating the selling store should replace it. By now, after several ATT dog and pony shows, failure on their part to do the right thing, my wife had had enough, drove sixty miles back to selling store, dumped the non working S8+ phone as well as the Samsung 8in Tablet they had also talked her into buying with the S8+, demanded a refund for all and a receipt for the returned equipment. ATT store clerk didn't have the authority to do an immediate credit, stating she would have to get the owner to do it over the next few days. Seven days go by with no credit on her acct so she now drives back to store, talks with the clerk again, who immediately credits her acct and credit card for all eqpt. Store clerk admits that this was 3rd Samsung S8+ returned within the last week for similar problems. Meanwhile, a few days later a Samsung factory rep comes by this ATT authorized store, poo poo's the apparent S8+'s problems, stating that it was just probably a bad batch of S8 phones, with no other explanation. Well, now my wife feels pretty much snake bit by Samsung and ATT over this uncalled for ordeal and is in all probability going to change to Verizon or some other carrier and I am sure, by now you have surmised she will not be purchasing a Samsung anything. She's too scared of them and what appears to be a lack of current quality control on Samsung's part compared to their good reputation in the past. Having been an ATT customer for more than ten yrs, she was very surprised and disappointed to learn of ATT's apathy and argumentative nature when failing to back up their phone with proper service after the sale. Additionally, I have been an ATT cell phone customer on my line since 1989(formerly BellSouth) and we are long time Direct TV customers. After seeing how she was treated I am also considering looking elsewhere for a different carrier and equipment, after continuously being their customer for over 28 yrs. Any company and any carrier can have problems. It's how they handle those problems that either insures brand loyalty or causes you to look elsewhere. All they had to do was to do the right thing to start with and give her a new phone that worked. Having refused to do that, what can we possibly expect from them in the future. We are currently paying almost $300.00 a month to ATT for our phone and Direct TV service. Even that did not motivate them to replace the phone, a phone which at the time was less than a month old. We sincerely hope your experience with both ATT and the Samsung S8+ phone is a better one than hers was. My phone is overdue for an upgrade but living thru her experience causes me great pause in considering any new Samsung product, inspite of fact that I have had my S4 Active for several yrs with no problems. I have never looked at another cell phone network provider in all my yrs of ATT service but I now feel compelled to at least see what they can provide.",2.0
164,Amazon,Samsung S8,"I have had this phone for several months now.This phone has great specs and does not fail in that regard. It also contains many of the features expected of flagship phones such as waterproofing and wireless charging.With that said, I had 3 concerns when initially purchasing this phone after coming from a Nexus 6P.1. Phone updates, including upgrades to new versions of Android.2. Non-stock experience, including many Samsung apps already installed.3. Single bottom firing speaker.With that said, the first issue is still a concern. Updates are slow, especially considering that my previous phone is already on the latest version of Android. This is a huge disappointment and will likely prevent me from purchasing another Samsung phone again.The second issue has been less of a concern for me. Many of the Samsung apps add additional functionality that is not found in stock Android. They are very usable and are worth giving a try.The third issue is still and issue, but some people have been able to enable stereo functionality, but will require rooting the phone.

167,Amazon,Samsung S8,"I have had this phone for about 5 months now. Now I have owned the S4, Note 4 and now the S8. Samsung is notorious for lag after some months of use. As a previous Samsung phone owner I took some steps to try and mitigate any lag as best I could. I install AVG Cleaner and consistently let it run to clean my device of any unnecessary junk. I reboot it at least once a week! I clear it's ram and delete any background memory hogs that might slow it down. Despite this it has managed to lock up on me at least twice in the 5 months that I can remember and self reboot. There is still some latency but overall it has been pretty responsive. Given the option to purchase it again now that I have had it for 5 months I can't say I would have made another choice. After 5 months it's still a solid phone and in my opinion one of the best phones available as of writing this review.  When I was looking for a new phone to buy 5 months ago I was seriously considering leaving the Samsung line, I was fed up with their notorious lag and wanted something more stable. On the day I decided to buy the phone Samsung had the best deal out. I am glad I waited a while and didn't buy it as soon as it hit the shelves. The price dropped and it came with two free gifts!Verdict... Great phone! Not perfect!  but... Just Great!",4.0
168,Amazon,Samsung S8,"I waited until recently to purchase the S8+ as my original intention was to get the Note 8 upon its release (after waiting a year after the aborted Note 7). However, all things considered it was difficult to justify the price of the new Note at almost $1,000 whereas the S8+ through Amazon was markedly cheaper.So, the decision was made and I am very happy with the phone as I was in desperate need of an upgrade from my S4 model. I got the S8+ as I was keen to have a larger screen and this screen does the job - large enough to watch videos etc but not so big that it feels awkward.  I haven't spent much time using the camera yet but it is certainly better than my old phone but not sure if it stacks up against my wife's iPhone.I am into the Android ecosystem and the phone worked seamlessly with my Gear watch out of the box.All told, I believe this phone is still state of the art and represents good value for money. I am not sure how much further mobile device manufacturers can go with new models at the $1,000 level but, IMHO, it makes sense to wait a while and purchase a slightly dated phone at a slightly discounted price as you still get lots of bang for your mobile buck!",5.0
169,Amazon,Samsung S8,This is one of the coolest cells ever. I had no problem activating.  I read many reviews before buying it and was all prepared to go through the drama everyone said with activating.  First I connected to my WiFi and transferred everything. Which was simple. The phone walked me through connecting the sub and my old droid. The transfer took 1hr 17m. Then I removed my sim card insert it. The phone detected it was a Verizon SIM and completed update. I was able to make a call immediately. The phone walks you through every feature and it is so simple. Don't believe all the negative reviews. This phone is worth it.,5.0
170,Amazon,Samsung S8,"**CAVEAT EMPTOR** My phone and phone box were labelled with the wrong MEID number. When I called Sprint to activate, they told me it wasn't unlocked, so you can imagine my frustration. I finally figured out that if you dial *#06#, it will show you your phone's serial number, MEID #, and IMEI#, which turned out was different than what was on the box or the back of the phone. When I then called Sprint to activate with the actual number and my Sprint SIM card, and everything worked out fine.As to the phone itself, it's great. The screen is nice and large, responsive, good speakers, I like the water resistant design, and the swag is great (comes with the charger w/ USB cable, a transfer USB set to transfer info from your old Samsung phone, and a set of headphones.

171,Amazon,Samsung S8,"I was skeptical at first when switching from Apple IPhone 7 to the Galaxy 8 after using Apple products for a long time.  Well after using it for a few weeks its going back for an IPhone 8.  Most of the basic features were ok and worked fairly well but had tons of app crashing than with Apple.  The main thing I hated here was you could never fully disable Google data raping.  My phones battery was literally draining due to all the back ground app data sharing with google and if you disable it it's still turned on it 50 other places it 50 different ways.  The display, ease of use, quality and value for money pales next to the IPhone.  if Android was not made by Google it might be a better mobile OS.  The software spends so much time data mining it lags the rest of the experience.  The phone is also cheaply built for such a priming price not to mention its lacklustre battery life even with battery saver compared to iPhone 8 or X.",1.0

It was just too hard to reach and inconvenient to use.",3.0
174,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Overall pretty nice phone. Being water resistant is a major plus, and the fact that the touch screen still mostly works while wet is amazing. It kind of stutters and lags a tiny bit which was disappointing. Battery life is hit or miss. Sometimes it lasts 2 days, and sometimes less than 1. Obviously that should be my fault for using apps that drain the battery but I can't figure out why it happens. I'm not a huge fan of the wrap around screen and it makes me really paranoid since almost no cases actually protect the sides. It could be cool technology when they do a 360 degree wrap around screen that covers the back as well, but in its current state I don't really get the point. It does look pretty though (is that the only point...?). Glare is kind of an issue. Bixby is completely awful and I can't believe Samsung locked out the button so people can't reprogram it to do something useful. I don't get why they're competing with Google on that front, and also don't understand why they're competing in the cloud storage market. Another wtf decision is why they include an awesome AMOLED screen but don't take advantage of the power saving features unless you install third party black themes.Major concern: Samsung Premium Care will not cover phones purchased from Amazon, but they will still accept your money. Super scummy move in my opinion. There was no mention of it until I asked a rep (and good thing I did).Despite my many complaints about Samsung's strange decision making, the hardware is pretty good and the stock OS works well with some tweaks.",4.0
175,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Phone is cool, can definitly do a lot with it. For once I actually found some of the pre-installed apps to be usefull. Disapointed in the battery life, not nearly as good as all the hype.",4.0
176,Amazon,Samsung S8,"I purchased my Galaxy S8 from the Samsung site only because they gave me $200 for my old phone (Galaxy S5). I was hesitant at first, given some of the negative reviews here and also elsewhere on the web. I have now owned the phone for over a month, here are my impressions.1. Red screen: This was one of my main concerns, since many people seem to have received phones with red screens. The phone does have a setting that is called ""blue light filter"", which I find awesome because it tends to protect your eyes from the damage these screens cause especially when used in the dark. With this setting turned on, the colors do tend to look reddish at first, but you quickly get used to it. Otherwise, you can turn it off and the colors of the screen are simply amazing. So I had absolutely no issues here. The screen resolution and size are exceptional.2. Fingerprint scanner: It's on the back of the phone, right next to the camera. At first, I'll admit it was a bit inconvenient, since I had some trouble putting my finger on the scanner rather than the camera. However, the minute I got a case for the phone, this stopped being an issue, since the case border is useful as a guide to put my finger in the right spot. At this point, the scanner is great, it easily recognizes the fingers I have registered and is many times better and faster than the one I had in my prior phone. I am 100% used to it now and even look for the scanner in the back whenever I hold a different phone. So again, no issues here, even if there are a ton of reviews saying that people can never ever get used to it. I actually like the location of the scanner now.3. Size: I had a Galaxy S5, which had a 5.1"" screen. This one has a 5.8"" screen and feels much better. The S8 feels long at first but the dimensions ""make sense"" and you quickly get used to it. There's even an advantage here: I normally carry my phone in my front pants pocket and since the S8 a bit longer I can grab it more easily than I did the S5. I have found the S8 much more comfortable than the S8+ both to carry and to hold, and I haven't missed the extra half inch that the S8+ has.4. Hardware and performance: This is a top-of-the-line phone and I have had absolutely no issues with lag, freezing, quality, or anything I can think of. Videos look amazing, the camera and the camera software are quite more advanced than I am as a user, the sound from the speaker is missing nothing, and the sensors (iris, heartbeat, light, focus and so on) all work perfectly. The phone also comes standard with AKG headphones and they are by far the best I've had, both in sound quality and in the materials used, I feel like they will last for a long time. I also had a problem at first with things like the edge bar getting in the way whenever I was playing a game, but it was a user error: the phone comes with game mode, which easily and quickly hides the edge bar while in a game, so it doesn't get in the way, and the minute you leave the game the edge bar is back on its own. I bought the phone in Coral Blue and the phone color is very attractive.5. Some things I do not like (note: all these things are minor issues for me, that's why I gave the phone 5 stars):5A) Sometimes I don't get notification sounds if, for example, I receive a message after several hours of not receiving one (in the mornings, for example). I just notice that the notification is there all of a sudden. I have tested this and it in fact happes with several apps. I'm sure this will have an easy fix with a software update, but for now I cannot trust notification sounds 100%. Note: this is only true of the sound, the notifications do appear correctly all the time.5B) Like I said before, the headphones are absolutely great. However, they have a quite sturdy and long cover for the jack, and using the phone in landscape mode with the headphones connected is a bit uncomfortable since the cover gets in the way quite a bit. This is inconvenient but by no means a huge issue.5C) Bixby is still very limited, but the phone comes with Google Assistant, which I have found even better than Siri at times. I would just prefer that the physical Bixby button could be configured to use with Google Assistant. It's also a minor issue, since I can always press and hold the home button and get Google Assistant just as easily.5D) There are some web pages where, if you're watching a video in landscape mode and then turn to portrait, the video will not resize. This can be solved by hitting the back button but it's inconvenient. Note: I found that this is true also for the iPhone 8 that my buddy has. Also note: this happens only in *some* pages, most of them work fine.5E) I was surprised at first to learn that there were no tempered glass screen protectors at the Samsung store for this phone. Then it made more sense, since the screen shape does not allow for a good protector. I have bought a couple of relatively inexpensive ones but they don't quite fit the phone or get loose very quickly. I would recommend that you save your money and don't buy any of those off-brand screen protectors for this phone, they won't work. I would prefer to have a screen protector for this phone but I can't have one, unless it's the plastic one Samsung sells.6. In summary: The phone has an extremely attractive design and mine gets noticed quite a bit, so socially it's great. It's also an impressive piece of hardware, so when I'm alone I also enjoy it quite a bit. I have been told that my voice sounds clearer to the other person when I'm in a call since I have had this phone; I can also say that I can hear the other person much more clearly in this phone. The camera is outstanding, the sound and video quality are impressive, and the phone itself is very comfortable to use. Also, I came from a Galaxy S5 and the transfer of data and settings from that phone to the S8 was very quick and easy, and I was impressed at how much this felt like it was my own phone right from the beginning. I would definitely recommend this phone above any others in the market right now.",5.0
177,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Oh yeah! Few things I have emotional response to when pleased, but this phone, I love him! The wrap around edge beautiful. Hi def screen. Options in depth.I'm getting to like Bixby too. It's helping open controller I can't find, look up things on the web, dial, message, calculate, set timer, define. Still exploring that feature.Fingerprint unlocks quickly. The complaints about location next to camera, I guess I got used to it faster than the average monkey! Since I use the phone in a holder in the car, I added a 3rd print, for when I reach over the phone in the holder, right index finger upside down.Iris recognition, cumbersome.  But when fingers are wet or in gloves, print reader fails. So iris scanner helps.Using for music and internet radio at the gym with belt holder and Bluetooth earphones.

178,Amazon,Samsung S8,"This phone is absolutely beautiful to hold and it has a sleek, 'new-car' feeling!Over all the functionality is similarly comparable across the Galaxy phones (4/7edge) with exception to few obvious changes (upgrades?) to the phone.  In the quest for the slick, they opted to take away the 'Home' button, which my fingers - as well as other iPhone/Galaxy users - have gotten subconsciously programmed to press, only to find that there are no buttons. I would need to 'swipe up' from the bottom of the screen and a virtual 'Home’ button, 'back' function and 'multi-window' interface becomes accessible.This phone has a Samsung Note8-esque interface (not to mention, the screen size difference between those two is just 0.1 inch!). So outside of the Stylus, S8+ promises to be just as versatile in its use!  One other function they did away with - because of the ‘Home’ button change - I have to use the Volume down+Power button to take a screenshot.  Using my thumb+middle finger to squeeze a shot may get some getting used to!The 3500mAh Battery holds well through the day (I use it heavily and I only seem to be down to about 35% by dinner time) and the only thing that seems to 'overheat' the product and/or shorten the battery life is when I am using it with VR.When I first had the Samsung S4, I was able to capture image of a beautiful low-light sunset (for which I was selected winner for a photography submission) and ever since then I’ve been HOOKED!  I took a photo of another sunset! This one was taken without any special filter and yet it beautifully captures the layers of the fading colors - S8+ exceeds it’s low-light capabilities of it's predecessors!  In addition, there are some new photo functions (swipe left in ‘Camera’). I love that as an inner (or Yelp) ‘Foodies’, I have my very own food filter to snap as many lunch or dinners as I pleased!  Use the 'Pro' function and I am Wow'd with the filter package it comes with!Getting an unlocked phone will give me the freedom to choose mobile network not just in the US but Internationally - which is great, as an international photographer to travel with and it sure beats carrying around multi handsets!  As an unlocked phone, this Samsung S8+ has both CDMA and GSM capabilities.  I went with a CDMA network, and the company blocked my ‘Talk and Surf’ function. On the bright side, CDMA does seem to preserve the battery life better so it’s a toss up!As the saying goes, ya either will Love it or Hate it, like Kimchee.  Take it from a diehard Macgirl that switched out of the iPhone to a Samsung.  It was worth it and haven’t gone back!  ?",5.0
179,Amazon,Samsung S8,"I recently traded in my galaxy S6 for this galaxy S8+. I am just going to say the 6 was way better!!

Then there is Bixby, which, well, just no. It is all bad. Then there is the cutting edge camera in this phone which is really just ok unless you want to zoom in and, no matter, the lightin, you may as well forget it. I definitely miss all the things about my Galaxy S6. Buying this S8+ was a huge mistake. The only good feature on this phone is the size of the screen. I love the Galaxy phones, but this particular model is just a huge fail! I would definitely recommend skipping this model for an earlier one or hopefully the next one that cpmes out will but a lot better. Veey unhappy with this phone.",1.0

181,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Samsung has created a wonderful upgrade to the S7. First of all, the 8+ has an increased screen size with superior clarity. The resolution is by far the best that I've seen on a smartphone. Also, the camera is very easy to maneuver with great quality pictures. There are many options to use to get creative. Next, the internal storage is quite adequate and double the S7's. My favorite feature is the battery life. Prior phones seemed to need charging constantly. The 8+ holds a charge very well and requires minimal charging. Since I am often ""on the go"", this feature is invaluable! Finally, the processor is far superior. I immediately noticed a difference when using the S8+. However, I would be remiss not to mention a couple of points that have been difficult to become accustomed to with this phone. The S8+ does not have a physical Home button - which I miss because I am a creature of habit. Also, I am constantly hitting the Bixby button when I am attempting to reach the volume buttons. The positioning of the buttons has been a bit challenging. With all of the positive upgrades, I would definitely recommend this smartphone.",5.0

It should be said I prematurely retired my perfectly good Samsung Mega (pre-Notes).  So this screen is way to small, small buttons, small type, small icons, small.  The wrap-around edge thing is bogus, just makes it hard to hold without a fat case.  Speaking, tiny thin flimsy and fragile.  The aftermarket is rich with contact screen stick-on guards and robust cases just so you can hold it without accidentally calling Russia, by accident.  Don't buy this stuff in AT&T store either. It'll cost 5x!  Strange charging cord, all my old ones are obsolete.  New Note isn't any better in size either; I liked my old phablet and they just can't be had any more.

187,Amazon,Samsung S8,"So I've owned a Pixil for a couple of years and then put it the washing machine.  Oops. I initially bought the S8, having visited a phone store and really liked the display. It's quite vibrant. However, in accustoming myself to the phone I had problems with ""Hi, Bixby"". Bixby is a 2nd AI on the phone designed to work and perform phone tasks. The 1st AI is ""Ok, Google"". One phone, two AI's and I never found out if they talk to each other. There are 10 levels to Hi, Bixby and I never got past level 3. Another problem was the news feed (which will probably not bother others as it did me) but every headline in the news feed was on top of a photo, so I had to process a picture as well as read a headline printed over variable colors. Add to that, instead of the feed being one box over another box it is in a hop-scotch format: one box over two side-by-side boxes over one box over two side-by-side boxes over....So my eyes have to jump all over the place to read a headline. Too much effort was required by me to read a line. The last problem I couldn't get over was the alarm volume. Can't get to the volume slide without setting an alarm to go off. The slide does not show up in the drop down menu for volume control. Nowhere could I find it in settings. And for the two daily alarms I have, lowering the volume doesn't remain low. It always went back to a default level. So I have returned this phone and got another Pixil.",3.0

189,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Operating System:  If you’re a Samsung user, or even if you’ve never owned a Samsung in the past, I highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy S8+.  This phone is by far the fastest operating phone that Samsung has ever made. This is the perfect phone for someone that spends a high amount of time on their phone and wants the speed of the phone to be able to keep up.  This phones operating system will not slow down for you, it will be able to handle anything you throw at it.User Interface:  This phone also has very friendly user interface.  You can make it as easy as you want, and on the other hand you can make it very customization with very complex setting that many people enjoy to toy around with.Battery Life:  The battery life on this phones seems to be incredible compared to the other Samsung’s in the past.  Even with being on social media, snapchat, and the browsing the internet for several hours a day, you will usually end the day with above 50% battery life.  There are many settings that you can toy around with to make the battery better.  One thing you are able to shut off to improve your battery life is the “always on display”, this is a feature that always shows what time it is, which uses unnecessary battery life.Water Resistant:  This is a great feature to have on a phone.  You never phone when you will accidentally drop your phone in the toilet, river, or other wet places.  You will enjoy the water resistant feature of your phone when you are able to fetch it out before there is water damage done to your phone.Fast Charging:  You will want to get this phone with the fast charger if possible.  Everyone hates waiting for their phone to charge, when you really need to use.  With this charger your phone will be charged in no time.Bixby:  The Bixby button on this phone is a feature where you tell it commands and it’s supposed to perform whatever task you tell it to do within the phone.  This is a nice feature for when you would be driving or really anything that needs to be hand free.  The one negative thing about this is that the button for it is directly below the volume buttons, so it often gets bumped on accident and goes off.",4.0
190,Amazon,Samsung S8,"These manufacturers are charging way too much money for cell phones these days.

Before this S8 I had an S5 and it was a very nice transition.This phone works and works well. I love that it's water proof and when it gets dirty I  just hold it on under running water and scrub if with hand soap. The naked phone is a bit slippery so I highly recommend the otter box defender case.I bought this phone on sale during Prime Day which gave a nice $200 discount plus they threw in a few free toys. The package included the wireless charging pad which I use everyday but would never pay extra for. It's really not necessary. And it came with the VR goggles which I still haven't taken out of the box. I know the goggles need the naked phone and I keep my phone in the otter box case so I'll never use the goggles.

It sounds like I'm playing whatever I'm listening to (mostly music and podcasts) from the inside of a box. I thought the muffled noise issue might have something to do with water exposure after being near the shower (I know, I know, water resistant does not mean waterproof), so I took some precautionary measures as soon as I noticed the distortion, turned it off, and tossed it in a bag with silica gel overnight. For a phone that's advertised as being resistant to spills, it's kind of a joke that sitting on a shelf outside a shower could spell disaster for its audio output.Additionally, the phone is a lot less durable than one would expect.

202,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Awful for photographers. Notice I said photographers and not photography because I'm not referring to the phone camera itself, I'm referring to the phone display. I shoot pictures on both digital and film to share on social media. The camera on the phone is great, not on par with some other flagship offerings, but the ability to shoot raw dng and edit in phone is much appreciated. However, as a photographer who shoot everything from landscape to macros to portraits, I must admit the phone display is absolute garbage. And I knew this coming in as some reveiwers such as MKBHD warned about the warmer and more saturated colors of this phone, particularly the red tones. Here's where the issue lies for me. I shoot a photo of a couple during an engagement session on my digital equipment, throw the picture on my computer with calibrated monitors and color grade to my liking yet maintaining accurate skin tones to the best of my abilities. When I upload the edited images to my phone, the skin color looks like a pumpkin barfed on an magenta crayon. I checked the images on an a few iPhones and LG phones and they look very close to how they did on my calibrated monitor. This poses several problems, 1. people who view my work on Galaxy phones think I suck at photography unless they realize that their display is at fault and 2. When taking raw images on the phone and editing with readily available apps, which is why I picked this phone, the colors I see and believe to be accurate isn't accurate at all! So my workflow would be to take the raw image on the phone, throw on my computer to edit and load back on the phone to share, you see how the workflow is slowed down considering I wanted all that work to be done promptly on the phone? I will admit that for landscape and macro where saturated colors actually enhances the images (depending on personal taste), this is a non issue. I just wish the display wasn't so pumped up like it is. Also I adjusted the display colors to cool it down as much as possible and the skin tones are still awful.The phone itself is top of the line, blazing fast, durable, water proof, detailed display. Nothing more you can ask for in a phone besides more muted reds in the display.",3.0

If you do manage to get in touch with them, they'll transfer you 4-5 times before telling you the department you need is closed. I pay AT&T $32 a month for this so I'm stuck, but I will NEVER purchase another Samsung product as long as I live and I recommend you don't either--they don't care about theit customers at all.",1.0

208,Amazon,Samsung S8,This was an upgrade from a Nexus 6p. Overall I'm very happy with the Samsung Galaxy S8. I do wish there was a way to easily disable Bixby. It's clunky at best. Personally I prefer Google Assistant.There are several blog posts with how to change Bixby to Google Assistant. If you are as frustrated as I am then I recommend you uninstall Bixby and switch over to the Google Suite of services.,4.0
209,Amazon,Samsung S8,"I bought this phone unlocked from another source. I was a Nexus phone user and was happily into my Nexus 5x usage for 1.5 years and it went into a bootloop (a known issue). I had to have a phone immediately so bought an S8.Pros;- Beautiful design, screen is awesome- I like how Samsung shows battery percent and data up/download in the status bar- Battery life seems pretty good- MicroSD card capabilityCons:- Screen design (curve) means much easier to break/damage, even with a case- Bixby button is easy to hit, a pain. Samsung has prevented owners from remapping it.- Volume buttons above Bixby button, way too high- FINGERPRINT READER location sucks, and shape sucks too. My Nexus had it right - center back, big pad and easy quick recognition- Samsung Touchwiz launcher is better than old days, but still why mess up vanilla Android? Splitscreen mode not as intuitive as vanilla Android. Home screen has much wasted space as second row of icons goes well above tray, wasting space. I ended up downloading the Google Launcher and that made a huge difference- Camera is surprisingly not as good as Nexus 5x, especially in low light (this is same camera as in Nexus 6p, and current PixelI called Google and even though my 5x is out of warranty, they are shipping me a refurb 5x free! So I am going to pay the restocking charge and return the Galaxy S8, and wait for the Google Pixel 2. Samsung has the name recognition but IMHO this phone is not as good as people think. Google's service was excellent and I'm happy to continue with them where I always have the latest OS and latest security updates as soon as they come out.",3.0

211,Amazon,Samsung S8,"I wanted to write a review about the product because other reviews helped me when deciding on whether or not to get this phone. AllI can say is get this phone. The phone itself is beautiful. It's sleek and fits nicely in your hand. The processor is fast, it's very responsive, and all around a great phone for this price. I've always been an Android user and this phone doesn't disappoint. Most of these reviews are about Bixby and how annoying she is, how the battery isn't as good as other Samsung phones, and the list can go on and on. Regardless of those things, I think it's still an all around great phone, because nothing is perfect. For this price, I would recommend getting this phone! Just remember to keep it protected no matter what! Hope this review helped other skeptical buyers! :)",5.0
212,Amazon,Samsung S8,"I bought this phone when it was on sale for $625. Great deal, based on other prices. I purchased this after my Galaxy S5 died. Coming from the S5, this is a major upgrade. The phone is beautiful, but due to my tendency to drop phones, I have it in a case. I expected to be annoyed by Bixby (based on other reviews), but I actually like ""her"" so far. She's not Siri, but I think she is better than Google's personal assistant. I like that you can unlock the phone by telling Bixby a voice password and because she learns your voice, she won't respond to another voice. My husband tried to talk to her and she ignored him.Besides Bixby, there are a number of upgrades from the S5. Rather than several pages with apps (you can still do that), there is an edge ""tray"" that you can use to easily access your favorite apps. I strongly recommend watching a youtube video to get to know the phone because it can do a lot. Without it, I wouldn't have known about the edge tray, because it is well hidden.

Extra side button which is easily hit by holding the phone.Fingerprint reader is in an awkward position on the back of the camera.  Unable to use thumb print unless turning phone around.So, if you're just looking for an expensive phone without the ability to respond to texts, or constantly pulling up Samsung's attempt at AI whenever you pick up the phone - then this one is a winner.  If you're looking to actually use all of your phone's capabilities - then I suggest going elsewhere.I've been with Samsung since the Galaxy S1 days, and this is by far, the WORST phone I have ever encountered (and I even had the Note 7 for a short time).

Amazing perforce. The new Bixby feature is a great move by Samsung. Google assistant makes the phone even better. The new screen off feature is too good. The edge feature is very usefull at times.

224,Amazon,Samsung S8,"I really love this phone. Best phone ever, hands down. Very well made and constructed",5.0
225,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Okay so to start off Samsung made an incredibly beautiful device however next time they should spend more time working and the hardware functionality.SoftwareMy phone before the Samsung s8 was the nexus 6p.  Needless to say the transition from having no bloat to a bunch of Samsung bloat took awhile to get use to. Touchwiz or tizen is not as bad as it use to be but the part I found most annoying was Samsung's very own so, Bixby.  Samsung even gave Bixby it's own button to access it but I found myself always pressing it on accident and unintentionally. When I would use an ai it would always be Google assistant it seemed more practical than Bixby. Needless to say Bixby is still young and has much to grow but it didn't really leave a lasting impression for me.BatteryThe battery on the s8 was not bad considering it's a quad hd bezleless screen.  When default settings(quad hd resolution mid brightness) were active on the battery I would get around 4 hours of screen on time.  When I changed the setting to full us resolution and low brightness I was able to get through a whole day.  The standby time on this phone is also great. My phone would have around 10% battery life before I went to sleep and when I would wake up it's only be at 8%.CameraUnlike most manufacturers Samsung didn't choose to go dual cameras on this device which wasn't really a bad thing.  This is one of the phones that proves more is not always better(more being more cameras). The back camera does a great job in low light performance and in my opinion still took better photos than the iPhone 7. The selfie camera was adequate it wasn't great in my experience cause Samsung software tends to smooth out the image alot when using the selfie camHardwareThis is the area where I just did not have a good experience with this phone. For starters the fingerprint reader.  I'm not going to complain about the placement but rather how accurate it is.  I had to same the same finger twice and I still can't unlock it on the first try.  I am frequently having to unlock my phone with my password instead cause of how many times it fails to read my fingerprint.  The charging port was another issue I was having. Samsung tends to promote wireless charging for a reason and it's because their charging port is not that great. I use the charger that came in the box and my phone sometimes doesn't even charge or sometimes it doesn't even read that it's a quick charge compatible charger. I tried other chargers but it was even harder to charge.  The other bad part of their hardware is that Bixby button it just isn't that needed and would have been better if the button could be remapped to some other function.DesignOverall the best part of this phone is the design. Samsung s8's design are in a class of their own due to those super thin bezles no one has really been able to match.  The edge display just makes the display experience all the better.",3.0
226,Amazon,Samsung S8,"I have had this phone since the day it came out. I am a poor college student but my phone that I had previously was not powerful enough for my nursing clinical. I waited to review this device because I wanted to run it through nursing clinical before I have it a good review.1). This phone is a very practical size. It has a large enough screen to be pleasant and easy to use buy without being clumsy in hand. The Super Amoled display is great the best on the market simply put.2). Software and Performance: So we all know Samsung has had its software issues in the past. It is just a really heavy and poorly optimized skin. On top of that, still being on 7.0 Nougat and not 7.1.1 or 7.1.2 is kind of frustrating. They are improved versions of Android with much better battery optimizations. As far as Samsung Experience is concerned, this is a huge improvement from previous iterations of Touchwiz. It is much smoother and more lightweight than before and it helps. With that being said it still has stutter issues. Not lag but stutter. No lag meaning there is no delay response when opening apps and such. But it does fail to open some apps smoothly sometimes. The Snapdragon 835 and 4 GB of ram do enough however to power through everything. I have an app on my phone that we use during clinicals. It has an entire library or medical terminology and practices that we need to be able to call upon at a moment's notice. This phone does not fail me. I also game frequently and this device blows through it.3). Camera: People and reviewers have complained that the camera is just not improved enough. Hmm...thats funny because a lot of those same reviewers have also said it is still one of the top 3 cameras on the market. It is very reliable and takes some incredible pictures. I use it a lot in class for some blackboard notes. Clear as day even in dark conditions. Just a great great camera overall.4)Battery: This has been a very controversial aspect of this phone. Some people have had good battery life, and some have had not so good battery life. I personally get good battery life but not stellar. I keep the phone on 1440p resolution because that is what I paid for, and I get about 4 1/2 hours of battery life. I wake up at 6:30 every morning and my phone lasts me tulle about 11 at night with about 20% to spare. I have had and seen better but the battery has been able to at least keep it's charge very well despite being several months old now.5). Overall: This device is a solid overall package. I think it nails most things but has a few of its querks. A lot of people will be wondering if the Galaxy S8 should be dumped for the Not 8. I would say no. I would personally wait for the S9 or in my case the Note 9. This phone is basically a smaller Note 8 with a single rear camera and no S pen. Unless you have money burning a hole in your pocket the Note has nothing outrageous to offer in comparison.",5.0

232,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Let me start by saying that i owned almost all the Samsung Galaxy phones starting from s2, and i am a big Samsung fan. However the recent crop of Galaxy phones is left to be desired when it comes to the form factor and the screen. The biggest issue is with the AMOLED screen, which is oversaturated and suffers from back light shimmer especially around text. It suffers from poor white balance and contrast, as well as from Blu light bleeding around the curved edges. The font is noticably less sharp than on Apple's retina displays, and whites are almost gray... Very bad rendition of AMOLED technology, IMHO...Second biggest problem with the latest Galaxy lineup is the  elongated form factor which is very hard to use with one hand, as well as view content in landscape mode. Not all applications support the ultra wide screen format, and the contents looks odd in a very short but wide viewing area...Also not insignificant the fact that the phone is literally very slick, and can easily slip out ones hands. The galaxy back cover of the case feels fragile, and the phone simply requires a case to have any semblance of durability. It is literally superslick and fragile... Huge design problem...and this is not to mention that especially in black it is a fingerprint magnet...It is a shame, sine the phone is really a good performer and has a good battery life...  and I really love Samsung's latest rendition of it's TouchWiz Android experience...I bought this phone unlocked from BestBuy thinking I would fall in love with it, but unfortunately I had to return it on the third day at a penalty.

233,Amazon,Samsung S8,"So this is the first time I have actually bought a flagship device from Samsung all my previous ones were of the other variety however I can say this is hands down the best device I've had to date.Pros:1. The price, considering the device usually goes for 700-800 USD getting in at 574.99 is a very good deal, this was the factor that made me get it over an iPhone.2. The camera and video quality is AWESOME. I've never had pics looking this great.3. Its super fast like the boot up was effortless and switching between apps is a breeze.4. Since all my previous devices were 1GB RAM and 8 GB memory having one now that is 4GB RAM and 64GB memory its an eye opener plus having expandable storage with an SD card just won my heart.5. Battery life is great. I can go one day without charging with moderate to high usage which is good.6. The speakers are loud AF like I was shocked when listening to Youtube videos.Cons:1. The finger print scanner, this should be a common cry at the moment but its is placed at possibly the most inconvenient place for a finger print scanner.2. The phone is made entirely of glass which for me is a concern cause i'm a klutz so I recommend getting a good case and a Tempered Glass screen protector.FYI: THIS PHONE IS UNLOCKED. It can be used with ANY carrier. I am using it in Jamaica right now and it works perfectly fine.I would recommend this phone to anyone because it has good internal and build quality.

239,Amazon,Samsung S8,"The Samsung Galaxy S8 is extremely helpful with all the features it provides and while also looking really beautiful at the same time. With its Snapdragon 835 Processor it allows the phone to run appropriately fast, and allows the user to be able to run most programs that couldn't be run on previous generations. With that and the four gigabytes of ram the new Samsung Galaxy S8 allows for two windows to be up on the same time; this allows for great multitasking. Even though the internals of the S8 are powerful, the externals are just as good or even better. The Galaxy S8 is by far one of the sleekest phones out there with its infinity screen and beveled edge. The screen it has gives it more real estate which allows it to give a nice wide angle view and look amazing on most applications. While the beveled double edge looks really nice it also is a very useful addition because it gives you the option for an incognito quick menu.this menu has an ever growing amount of possibilities; because it holds more than your top 5 contacts and your top 10 apps. There is a whole selection of extra pages for your bar ranging from far more than a notepad or a full on calculator which can come in handy for real quick math in the samsung app store. The galaxy s8 has one of the best battery lives, for it can last nearly a whole day on a full charge with general use. It also is very durable even though the whole body is made of glass it can sure take a massive beating as well as its water resistant.

It is very user friendly just as all Samsung Galaxies are. I know there is so much more I could tell you but just know it is a great phone overall.,5.0
252,Amazon,Samsung S8,"I was trying to decide between the Iphone X or the Samsung 8 Plus. Waited for the X to come out to compre, butt after going to my nearest Apple Store and playing around for a while I decided on the S8 for several reasons: first screen size..second memory expansion...and third ...photo quality...night pictures come out like a pro! you may even take a picture with voice command on the S8. Also transfering data from your old phone was very simple with Samsung connect.Last but not least..price..you would have to pay $300 more for the X !I had the S8 for one day and is a great phone!",5.0
253,Amazon,Samsung S8,"The Samsung Galaxy S8+ is a smart choice for a smartphone. This phone serves all the purposes you would expect in a modern smartphone and does so tremendously well. With a 3500 mAh battery, it lasts all day displaying all your information, entertainment, and communication needs on a beautiful edge to edge screen with a 6.2’’ Quad HD+ Super AMOLED technology with a easy to use UI (user Interface).As someone, who has been on #teamiPhone for the last 5 years making the switch was not an easy choice but after analyzing the market and realizing that now in the Fall of 2017 is the perfect time to switch markets. I switched markets and I am enjoying the S8 + more than I ever did a new generation iPhone. After letting my mom (a baby boomer) play with this new phone, it became quite clear that she could operate it with about the same level of competency as her iPhone 6+ running the latest OS. Granted, there is a steeper learning curve for older generations with newer technologies…I think it is safe to say that anyone at any age could operate the S8+ with ease and learn to enjoy life on the other side of the smartphone market. You should consider researching it further learning more about it’s incredible durability, waterproofing, and hardware specs.",5.0

255,Amazon,Samsung S8,"I love this phone,  this is the replacement of an iphone 5 and I don't miss it at all.  Before buying the Samsung Galaxy S8 I was debating if I should get the Iphone 8 instead but Apple's strategy of releasing 3 phones a couple months apart just didn't make sense to me, it makes you think.

257,Amazon,Samsung S8,"This phone is amazing but has one massive flaw. The edge to edge screen, while it looks and performs amazingly is the downfall of this device. You will break this phone.You could put a case on it to protect the glass edges. However, the case will only be effective if it is also covering the edges of the screen that your phone will fall on when you drop it. So if the only way to realistically use this phone without having to replace it every time you drop it is to cover the main feature, the edge to edge screen with a case. So what is the point of the phone? Save your heartache with cracked screans and invest in any of the competitors that won't shatter on the first drop.",1.0

One nice thing Samsung did was include multiple USB cable type adapters to make the transition to USB C less painful for those who have micro USB cables.

266,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Weakest screen I've had on a phone. I had a Note7 and the screen was indestructible. When I brought it back to the store during the recall, after they refunded me they started throwing the phone to see how much force it could take before breaking. The store employees were tossing it high in the air and it would fall on their hardwood floor unscathed. They eventually got it to break after many, many throws but it withstood SO MUCH before finally shattering. I assumed the S8+ would have the same gorilla glass as the Note7. Nope! In fact, the S8+ has one of the most fragile screens out of any recently released phone. Look it up. Mine fell out of my pocket about 1.5 ft and shattered, also damaging the LCD itself. Additionally, I recently got an ""offer"" from Samsung as a Note7 owner to trade my phone in for a Note8-- they offered me ""up to $450"" for a phone that I paid significantly more for. This will probably be my last Samsung phone after my recent experiences with their products.",1.0

BOY WAS IT A MISTAKE. The Galaxy S8 is complete junk compare to my Nexus 6p. First of all the fingerprint reader is right NEXT to the camera!!! So it's very easy to mistake the Camera for the finger print reader when you are not looking and it usually takes me several tries to unlock the phone. Second the phone only have one speaker on the bottom compare to the stereo speaker in my 6p. And YES it does make a difference!! Third, the curve screen completely sucks, it warps videos and side of webpages and ebook. Lastly as of today, it still doesn't have support for the latest android software while my 6p already supported it. In all honesty if I had to choose all over again I would have chosen the LG V30 or Pixel 2 or IPhone X. Heck I would've chosen my old 6p over this phone. So yes please stay away from this phone, it's definitely not worth the price.",2.0

283,Amazon,Samsung S8,"I am going to review what I consider the most important features of a phone.Screen (5/5): literally, the most beautiful display I have ever seen. At first, I wasn't sure how the whole curved screen thing was going to play out but after just one day with it I was already questioning if I could ever go back to a normal flat screen. It's awesome.Battery (5/5): I put this thing through its paces. The first few days I used Youtube a ton and played a bunch of games to get a feel for how fast the battery drains. To make it short and to the point, you could obviously drain the whole battery if you turned the brightness to max and just played graphics intensive games for hours, but if we're talking about moderate to heavy use for the average adult then this thing will last all day without even making it to critical levels. I think the lowest I've seven seen the battery after a normal day's use (lots of texting, some phone calls, a few games and some Youtube videos) is like 40%.Storage (5/5): Pretty simple to review this. 64GB is probably enough for most people, and even if it's not you can insert a microSD card.Call clarity (4/5): At first, I didn't realize I had the HD Calling feature on. This made the caller's voice seem super digital and weird, I didn't like it. After I switched it off, it improved the quality but it wasn't the best I've heard. By no means is it bad, just not the best,Feel (4/5): It's a long phone, so if you have small hands you might want to play around with it a little before buying. I have large hands so it isn't as much of a problem for me, but I can see why this might become an issue for others.Speaker quality (5/5): I was pleasantly surprised by the volume and quality of the speakers. Don't get me wrong, they are cell phone speakers, but compared to other phones the S8's sound is above average.Feel (5/5): This thing is sleek. I bought a minimalist case for it because I loved the way it felt in my hand. A few times, I had a moment of panic because I couldn't feel that it was still in my pocket. If you are prone to dropping your phone, I suggest getting a protection plan or a rugged case. I have not dropped mine yet, but I can easily imagine a single drop on a hard surface from waist level breaking the screen if it lands directly on it. The screen is supposedly pretty tough, but I wouldn't test it.If I think of more things to review I will update this, but for now I think that's all I have to say about the Samsung S8. Overall, I've never felt more impressed by a new phone",5.0
284,Amazon,Samsung S8,Had this phone for a couple months now and I thoroughly enjoy all the features especially the camera.

Especially if you are coming from as old device as Galaxy S4. I remember vividly watching Samsung's reveal of beautiful S4. For those who don't know, S4 is the best selling smartphone of all time which, even to this date, performs quite well unlike competitor's smartphone of same generation. Even from that perspective, Samsung has come a long way in terms performance (much better touchwiz), ux (perfect mix of simplicity and feature-fullness for adv. users) and most noticeably design - S8 is the marvel of industrial design and I only hope Samsung will continue delivering innovation on the market for many more years.",5.0

295,Amazon,Samsung S8,"I have owned the galaxy S2,S3, and S6(flat Display). With all of those phones I was happy from purchase, to replacement (usually fleeting battery life). I have just purchased two(one for me and my significant other) of the Galaxy S8+ phones, and am somewhat disappointed. I was reluctant to purchase at first because of the edge screen being forced upon me, but I could no longer deal with old phones. Here are some of the things I have noticed.Cons1. Screen glare - when in lit areas I seem to always have a glare on one side of the edge. Even in Samsung's display pictures there are glares on both sides of the screen. (hard to be unseen once noticed)2. Screen protectors - I have tried 3 so far none seem to like to stick to the screen well and two interfere with cases I've tried.3. Cases - Not a problem yet, but all the cases I have tried seem leave something to be desired in protection. A lot of the front of the phone seems uncovered.(very nerve racking, mostly due to curved screen)4. Finger print scanner - WHY OH WHY IS IT ON THE BACK? Next to the camera non the less. Unlocking with single hand can be a little tedious. Because hand placement for use, and unlocking it are different. Kind of have to slide it around your had to do one or other. Thick cases can make it hard to get proper finger placement.5. On screen buttons - I have had phones with them before, HTC M8. After about a year the phone slows a touch, and they seem to take a couple seconds to appear. May be an no issue with this in the future.Pros - (most other flagships are equal here)1. Battery - Very good battery life. After a day of moderate use its still over 40% remaining.2. Speed - A very fast phone, little to no lag launching apps.3. OS - I do like the Samsung version of android over some of the other companies. Probably because I've had so many of their devices.4. Camera - Very fast and great pictures. video recording is very high quality too.In conclusion, I would recommend looking at other options if you are on the fence about the infinity(edge) display.  I took a chance and do slightly regret it. I am currently stuck with the phone for most likely the next few months.Only way I'll buy a Samsung again is if,1. I can get a flat display again2.

Bixby can download apps for you if you are to lazy to type and that is basically all I use it for, otherwise Google assistant all the way.",5.0
322,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Edit : Added a photo of my cracked phone (The red light is from my led strip)This phone was awesome until a 2 feet drop. The screen was shattered and I had a bitter experience. I haven't fixed the phone at the moment because it will cost $200. YES! TWO FREAKING HUNDRED DOLLARS man. I got the phone from Samsung website for $561, not from Amazon. However, I couldn't write a review on their website because I think they realize that they make a trash phone that can crack when you fart on it. If you wanna know how I think about the phone here is the list of pros and cons.Pros :- Vibrant color screen- OOOOO So sleek design- ""VIRTUALLY"" Indestructible- Free AKG headphones- Decent camera- LED notification indicator- Samsung ""smart"" switch- Good music playerCons:- Indestructible my ass- Easily crack screen and they will suck your money out- They don't care how you drop it but you will have to pay- Cracking the screen will void you from your warranty- Rear can be scratched easily- Awkward finger print scanner- Apps always crash- Best phone my assAvoid Samsung at all costPS. I just dropped it in the afternoonand I WANT MY REFUNDDON'T BUY SAMSUNG EVER AGAIN!!! THEIR PHONES ARE TERRIBLE",1.0
323,Amazon,Samsung S8,Great phone but has few cons comes with it. It gets scratch  very easy; from front to back. So get a screen protector  and  a case *asap* if not you will regret it. I sure did.,3.0
324,Amazon,Samsung S8,"This phone has been amazing! I purchased it when it was roughly $550. Retail price was $850 with T-Mobile (ridiculous)! Overall the phone has worked amazing.

326,Amazon,Samsung S8,"This is a great phone let down by one major flaw of a super scratchy screen. I have had an S3 and and S5 in the past and this was a step up. I love the display, the memory, the speed, and the color. If it was just for that I would have given this phone 5 stars. I have had this phone for only 3 days and there is already a bunch of scratches on the screen. And deep enough to pick up with your fingernail. I never had this problem with the previous Samsung phones. In fact I went caseless for the entire 2 year life of the S5 and only picked up one scratch when it fell to the floor of the truck once. I haven't treated this phone any different and have not dropped it or otherwise abused it but there are still noticeable scratches and marks. This alone makes the phone a ""DO NOT BUY"" in my book. Maybe if it was HALF THE PRICE but not at over $600. I seriously think that the screen isn't even glass but PLASTIC. A big step backward for Samsung.",2.0
327,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Best phone I've had yet! Beautiful display and advanced features. It takes beautiful pictures, has fast charge and long lasting battery life.

359,Amazon,Samsung S8,"The screen, camera, and overall build are phenomenal.The Samsung version of Android is complete crap. The only version of Android that should be put on flagships is the pure version, plain and simple. Why does Samsung still have a proprietary app for everything Google already does so well? Then I have to tell the phone that I want to use the Google version for every default app. Don't even get me started about the fact that Facebook is preinstalled and CAN'T BE UNINSTALLED. I don't even have a Facebook account.. You can't remap the Bixby button to Google Assistant without a third party app? I simply disabled it to prevent myself from accidentally opening that crap assistant. The software for a 2017 flagship is atrocious.One of the selling points of this phone for me was the SD card expansion option. I bought a 128 GB SD card and downloaded all my Spotify music for offline use and all was good. Until one day, about 2 weeks into owning the phone, the SD card reader simply stopped working. After checking out some forums I realized this is an issue that Samsung won't address. This was the straw that broke the camel's back and I couldn't forgive Samsung for all the things I didn't like about the phone. I sent it back within 2 weeks of owning it.If you want a pure Android experience with great hardware, this is not the phone for you. If you're switching from an iOS device, or simply aren't into customizing your experience AND you don't mind not having advertised SD card support, go for it.",3.0

Iris scan is a better option and that works nicely.Not the phone's fault, but getting this thing from Amazon was a nightmare.

419,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Despite reviews, the camera is not very good. Specifically, the native dynamic range is very limited, and the HDR feature seems to be faked in software (with poor results) as opposed to ""real"" HDR where multiple images are captured at different exposures and blended together into one.When shooting at night, areas around light bulbs are bleached. When shooting during the day in contrasty scenes, the blue sky is bleached white, even with the HDR mode on.My 2014 iPhone 6 plus does not have a problem capturing the dynamic range of these scenes without bleaching, and takes much better overall pictures (despite the lower pixel count) because it has real HDR that works well.I even tried a 3rd party true HDR camera app. But, in the darkest exposure setting the areas around light bulbs at night are bleached. Basically, the camera's hardware just doesn't have the range to do it.Also, the camera has awful halo effects at night, regardless of whether I use the stock camera app or the paid premium one. Streetlights, etc. have horizontal lines that run across the screen from end to end.I am thinking of getting rid of this brand new phone because the camera is so sub-par compared to my past iPhones. In fact, my iPhone 4S has a preferable camera in some ways because it does HDR properly.The 1080p video is also inferior to my 2014 iPhone 6 plus. There is a notable lack of detail and contrast in the videos. While it is encoded as 1080p, apparently due to compression artifacts or whatnot, there is a notable loss of detail that makes the result look like a good 480p shoot.And the audio for video, while fairly good, is also inferior to the 2014 Apple model. This is quite apparent when shooting at a concert.And, the S8 chews through battery rapidly, even with almost all app push notifications and auto updates turned off, and even with the phone in the middle battery saving mode with the processor and display throttled back. I couldn't get through a day in an amusement park without running out of battery.Lastly, while the OLED screen has stunning brightness and color gamut, the color accuracy is notably off. I found this to be occasionally irritating when watching movies, and it prevented me from accurately adjusting photos with photo editing apps.The phone is quite nice looking, and the iris scanner works better than I expected. The front facing camera the best I've yet seen.

The screen seems to gather fingerprints more than my old S3, but aside from that I don't have any complaints off the top of my head. The major problem I've already stated.

460,Amazon,Samsung S8,"After great experiences with my s4 & Note 4 i couldn't pass up the Prime day deal on the S8. The camera is crazy and the phone itself is solid as a brick (and looks  good just sitting there). Nougat and Bixby take some getting used to (I haven't given up and resorted to a custom launcher yet). You can't customize LED colors for different apps/callers. There's still one tiny speaker instead of adopting stereo speakers like other companies. But my biggest complaint is the Bluetooth is Fubar. The forums are full of people that can't get this series phone to sync with radios or speakers. I've tried three cars and two speakers and the only thing it successfully pairs with is the controller for the VR headset. Thankfully my Note4 works just fine for mobile entertainment, but I can't use my car's hands-free calling features.It's a fine phone, Still has a headphone jack...which apparently I'll need for music since the Bluetooth doesn't work right, but is missing stuff that should have been caught before shipping.",3.0

It's so super narrow it's about the same width as a normal ratio 5"" phone. It appears much smaller in person than I expected when I ordered it.That I may be able to adapt to. It's the curved edges that are horrible. Not only do they make it appear even more narrow, but things on the edge are slightly distorted and the color is off unless you look at it dead on, and even then I can see a bit of distortion and discoloration on the curved edges. At an angle it's unbearable the way the edges are darker than the rest of the screen. It's especially noticeable when the screen is a solid light color, with the edges having a blue tint.This alone is a deal breaker for me. It's hard to look at. If it was a flat, even surface it would be so much better. I don't predict this gimmick catching on. At least I hope it doesn't.",2.0

There are layers and layers and needless, annoying complexity that I don't want or need. The worst thing about this phone is it is UNPREDICTABLE. Today I COULD NOT answer an incoming call even though the phone was in my hand! I had been browsing the Internet on Chrome and could HEAR the ring  but NO INTERFACE to answer. A day or two ago I got no interface to shut off the LOOKOUT scream feature. Sometimes I get the proper interface, other times not! Full of surprises!Bixby is useless and annoying as well, and so is the ""battery charging"" screen. Getting into the phone is a hassle most of the time. Sometimes you have to do your pattern, then swipe past a screen or two then do you pattern AGAIN. Why? Who knows. Next time it might be different!Samsung should stick to HARDWARE and let GOOGLE do the software. Give people ANDROID STOCK phones and stop trying to compete with your own partner. Please! PLEASE!!! If Samsung didn't waste money paying designers and developers to add GARBAGE that degrades they phone, it would probably be better AND cheaper.I think letting you answer calls is JOB ONE for a PHONE.Mine fails that most basic task...sometimes...because it is clogged with a bunch of kludgy garbage software.

597,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Just an average phone. The selling point being that it's an ""edge"" is kinda pointless being that most cases cover up around the edges. Gets in the way of some video formats, covering the bar. And the screen protector helps but because of the ""Edge"" it leaves the sides exposed. Now the case will cover it as I said, however it will also slowly peel the Screen protector off. And believe me you are gonna need that case. All the protection you can get. Had a foot drop, not only do I have a cracked screen but an actual hole. Waterproof selling point out the window. With such a high maintenance phone, idk why you would have it near water in the first place. Had this for a few weeks, battery was great until recently,  drains more quickly now. Damn ridiculous. (Update: beside battery continues to diminish it total life span, now having trouble shooting and storing photos. They become corrupted) I'm done with this phone, should of given LG a chance.",1.0

617,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Bought at Sam's Club. 17 days after owning the phone it would no longer charge at the port. There was  defect in the connection. I contacted the company.  They had me send in the phone for repair.  Eleven days later (yesterday) I got my phone back. Charging port worked fine, but then the phone kept shutting down and restarting. I couldn't even get it to stay on long enough to set it up. I contacted the company again and I have sent off the phone again for repairs. Where the phone is barely used I wish they would just replace it so that I could have an experience without a defective phone.  I spent a lot of money on this phone.  The phone is beautiful in design, but I was not going for beauty, just reliability, and it failed, miserably.  Because of this experience with the phone and customer service, this is, most likely, my last Samsung phone purchase. If you buy this phone, you'll need the warranty. Unfortunately,  I didn't buy the warranty. I had already paid more than intended for the phone. I didn't have the funds for the warranty.",1.0

622,Amazon,Samsung S8,"1rst and biggest, you have to get a case. This phone is so slippery it's silly. I set it on a pillow the other morning it would not stay.  gravity slowly Slid it off. I've dropped this 600$ phone twice in less than a week. It has rounded/tappered edges hardly any bezel to get a purchase on. Yes this is normally a good thing, but dropping sucks.2nd finger print sensor is in a poorly thought out spot next to camera lens. It's hard to say where to place it because it feels natural where they put it. Maybe move camera, Regardless your camera lens Will be smudged.3rd bixby not interested in it and I don't have a choice. The dedicated button is in the worst spot.  If I hold phone in landscape to take pic, watch video, or what ever I hit the button (by the way I'm left handed) with thumb. Phone is so slick holding in landscape position is precarious already. Samsung and bloatware, bixby is to much and to dedicate an annoying button to it is absolutely dumb.4th the screen is curved on edges and can be touched or tapped. I have big hands, phone is slick, phone is thin, and edges are round so i try to grip it good especially in landscape. Watching a YouTube video as an example either I hit bixby button or  accidently hit top left corner  of screen dropping notifications bar down or in YouTube back video up 10 seconds(how i am double tapping is beyond me). I have ordered a case it's been a week waiting on shipping I hope this fixes most of these problems. Being one of the more expensive phones out there, You would think these things would be thought through.5th I liked having removable battery option but LG doesn't offer any more. So I am assuming no decent smart phone has that option anymore. But on average I get a new phone every 2-3 years and generally battery would be replaced once in that time. 600$-700$ it should last that long. Seems to be a rant but for the money it should be better. And for god sakes stop with the bloatware, and a dedicated physical button. Seems like your are trying to piss off customers.",2.0

651,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Excellent phone.  The only three things keeping me from giving this a 5 star rating are:1) No replaceable battery.  If the phone locks up you have to hope holding down the down and power buttons will interrupt the phone and force a reset.  Also, when the battery will no longer hold a charge you are SOL (And this will happen sooner or later...it will force you to buy a new expensive phone even if a new battery would fix the issue at a much reduced cost).2) Bixby...just plain annoying!  The button is in an awkward location and when you hold the phone horizontally it causes Bixby to turn on unless you stretch your hand/fingers into awkward locations.3) Curved glass.  While this looks sleek and ""sexy"" it is kinda annoying.  If somebody is standing anywhere near you they can see what is going on on your phone.  Also makes screen protectors a lot more expensive and elaborate.Can't argue much with the price though, much cheaper here on Amazon than anywhere else.",3.0

804,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Excellent phone, beautiful aesthetics, and a taste of the future worth paying for: 9/10.TL;DRGorgeous & futuristic phone, industry-leading screen, excellent and reliable (rear AND front) camera, full-day battery, water and dust proof, wireless (fast) charging, and Bluetooth 5.0!  On the downside, it won't receive timely software updates, and fingerprint scanner location is a minor setback.It's hard to choose your next phone because there are so many good options today, and potentially good phones coming later this year (2017). By now you've probably seen a million reviews on the S8, but it doesn't make the decision easier. Here's my suggestion, in two quick steps. Make sure none of the cons below are deal-breakers for you. Then, look over the list of unique advantages, and see if they get you excited enough to pay the hefty $750. If you're still here after that, then welcome to the club! Be sure to check out my final tips for maximizing your S8 experience.CONS:1. Edge screen is beautiful, but annoying in two situations.  It creates visual distortions a little (less than S7 Edge though).  It is also difficult to hold the phone up in the air, face down (e.g. before sleep), as the phone is prone to accidentally registering side touches.  A case remedies the latter problem, but I dislike putting a case on such a beautiful phone (see pro tip #1).2. Samsung is not very good with software updates.  If you take great pleasure from trying new Android in a timely manner, this isn't for you -- the only two options are iPhones and Pixels.  That said, keep in mind that new software updates typically slow down the phone.3. Fingerprint scanner location has been mentioned a gazillion times.  Yes, I wish it was on the front.  No, it really isn't that bad on an S8 (S8+ is a different story).  You know, we have this thing called ""muscle memory""..  It took me two days to adjust to the new location, and now I have no problems.  If you really hate it, try facial recognition or iris scanner, they're very good (see pro tip #8)4. The phone has glass back that’s prone to cracking, so watch out if you’re clumsy.  But see pro tip #15. S8 doesn’t have monster battery life, and it needs to be charged once a day.  If you need to go past a day, look elsewhere.6. Some are disappointed about a lack of dual-camera.  Personally, the rear camera is wide enough that I am rarely in a situation where I feel the need for a wide-angle lens (like in LG).  An optical zoom would have been nice (like in Iphone 7+), but not really an issue for me (see pro tip #6)UNIQUE ADVANTAGES1. Futuristic aesthetics of a bezelless all-screen phone.  This doesn’t really improve the functionality of the phone, but there’s just something satisfying about this futuristic experience.2. The screen is just so damn beautiful, no contest here.  Always-on display is useful.3. As of today, it’s the only phone that checks ALL of my needs: Excellent rear camera, excellent front camera (reviewers too often ignore this), water proof, dust proof, wireless (fast) charging, full-day battery life, a headphone jack, a micro SD card slot, fingerprint scanner, and after using the S8, Bluetooth 5.0!4. Bluetooth 5.0 is amazing.  S8 is a first phone to come with this, and it’s awesome.  I frequently use the ability to connect to two different speakers at once, for a surround-sound like experience in my room.  You can also listen to the same music with your friend in a library, by connecting to two different headphones.5. S8 is also the first phone to come with Gigabit LTE, which is nice for future-proofing the phone, but it doesn't quite help us yet.PRO TIPS1. Consider getting a tempered-glass screen protector (they’re better on S8 than on S7 Edge) and a Slickwraps/dbrand skin for the back.  The skins make your phone look unique, improves grip, and it also helps cover up cracks if you’ve dropped your phone.  Slickwraps frequently has discount promotions on their website, so watch out for that.  Don’t use a case, enjoy the beautiful phone!2. Bixby is useless, and if you’re like me, most “Smart” assistants are still generally not helpful and just raises privacy concerns.  You can remap the Bixby button (as of April 2017): See https://www.xda-developers.com/3-applications-bypass-bixby-restriction/3. General Android tip: Go to Settings, Developer Options, set Window/Transition/Animator animation scales to x0.5 to speed things up (Google this if you don’t know what I mean)4. General AMOLED tip: Take advantage of black wallpapers to save battery life5. Set screen resolution up to QHD.  In my experience it barely affects battery life in everyday use.  Going HD will significantly improve battery life if you are a heavy gamer, or use CPU intensive apps a lot.6. If you really miss dual-camera set-ups in other phones, consider getting a separate smartphone camera lens kit that sells for ~$20.  They’re less convenient than a built-in dual lens, but on the upside they’re much more versatile and fun.7. If you are still not convinced whether to buy S8, then wait.  Most phones (except iPhones and Pixels) drop prices relatively quickly, and you may be able to snatch one up cheap refurbished in auction sites.8. Contrary to some reviews, the facial recognition and the iris scanner are reliable and fast.  In my experience, how you register your face/iris determines how effective it will be.  If you wear glasses, register with glasses on.  Also, register under medium lighting conditions and not in extreme conditions.  You want the phone to be able to recognize you under different environments.It's a really nice phone, highly recommended.",5.0

849,Amazon,Samsung S8,"****updated on 07/13/2017: I called local repair shop and they wanted to charge me $369 for the new screen. It does not even come with water resistance warranty. Yike!!!! This is not goood :(------------------------------------------I used to be a big fan of Samsung mobile devices. I used to own Galaxy S2, Note 2, Tablet (8 Pro?),... but I switched to be Apple fan after many losing battles against Samsung over their bad batteries and microUSB adapter issues.Recently, after many comparison between Samsung Galaxy S8 vs iphone7, I decided to make a switch back to Galaxy S8 because of its stunning screen display and the water resistance issue. I saw a review somewhere which said the S8 can handle water resistance better than the iphone7.UNFORTUNATELY, the sunning screen display of the Galaxy S8 disappoints me BIG time. It is really beautiful but this screen is very easy to break. I slipped it off my desk from alarm vibration and the screen cracked all over the front glass (the front screen hit the hardwood floor first from the drop). This incident happened to me after my 5 days of ownership with this phone. How disappointed! Unfortunately Samsung does not cover warranty for this type of thing, so please aware of this major issue and make according investment for protection plan.In more detailed feedback, here are 10 features I can say I love about this phone:1. Captured video and images by front and back cameras are all excellent (compared to iphone7). I took it to capture a few action moment at a beep baseball game this past weekend and all pictures and videos look stunning GREAT.2. finger print, iris scan and many smart login features are awesome.3. screen display looks stunning. No doubt here!4. phone size is fittable to hold in one hand5. expandable storage. Kudo to Samsung for starting the phone with 64GB as its based storage.6. great sound for media (Netflix, youtube, HBO and many other streaming services)7. great sound for phone conversation as well. I was driving on highway with my window slightly open (for air ventilation), and I could talk to my mom without and issue. Normally with other phone, she would not hear anything I said because of the hissing noise.8. wireless charging capability9. S8 supports USB-C type for easy insertion and removal of the cable. Samsung also provides an adapter for microUSB. I love this thought a lots when I saw it.10. Edge panel feature is pretty cool for quick app access.and here are features which make me hate this phone:1. The finger print button is on the back of the phone. I have a wallet styled case for the phone and it is not easy to reach the fingerprint button on the back. It would be great if there are both front and back or side buttons for this finger print feature.2.  stunning glass screen is very vulnerable to crack and shatter. The phone's frame does not have protection for the screen when there is a drop impact. Very sad now to see my new phone with damaged screen.3.  the compartment for the sim and microSD is somewhat hard to use. I found it to be challenged to sit both the sim and microSD card for insertion.4. Battery is not that great based on Samsung advertisement. Compared to iphone7, this S8 drains more battery.5. theme support does not have many free items. Most of the cool themes cost to own, so don't bother.6. curved screen sometimes cause issue for text to display and reading at side edgesCool advertised feature about the phone which I haven't gotten a chance to try:1.IP68 rated water resistance is cool but now the screen is cracked, so I haven't gotten a chance to try it. This water resistance feature was the main reason I bought the S8 over the iphone7, but now I cannot even utilize it.My wish: I hope Samsung pays more attention to the screen design and make it more bullet proof with better performance to accidental drop and bump impact. What is the point of having a stunning screen but it is so fragile to break.FINAL THOUGHT: I WOULD GIVE THIS PHONE A 5 STAR IF ITS SCREEN IS NOT FRAGILE. If anyone wants to buy this phone, be prepared to protect your screen. Invest into their Samsung Primary Care protection or buy good screen protector and case. Personally, when new iphone comes out, I might need to switch again as Samsung is once again losing me.Attached are pictures and videos I captured at the beep baseball game",2.0

851,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Solid performance, beautiful design, the latest processor as of 04/28/2017, Bluetooth 5.0! They fixed the problem that I had with the Galaxy S7 Edge that I often accidently touched the edges of the screen, it doesn't happen with the ""edges"" of this screen anymore. I have a Google Pixel XL and I'm going to switch for the Samsung Galaxy s8, not the S8+, because even with my big hands I have to stretch my hand to be able to reach for the fingerprint sensor of the S8+. The screen of the S8 is even bigger than the Google Pixel XL by 2% already and the total size of the phone is smaller than the Pixel XL.In terms of the software update, it's slower to be released than for the Google Pixel XL, but it's faster than for the carrier phones, like AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, etc.You can't go wrong with this phone, in general terms, comparing all the features, pros and cons, it's the best in the market.Pros:-Design-Wireless Charging-Latest processor-Bluetooth 5.0-Mobile HDR Premium technology-No problems (at least for me) in touching the edges of the screen accidently.-water/dust resistance IP68-Good battery optimization-USB Type-C-headphones 3.5mm input-AKG earbuds included-Great quality camera-Beautiful display (image)-USB Type-C to USB adapter included-USB Type-C to USB adapter included-Pay safely virtually at any store with Samsung Pay (something that Apple Pay and Android Pay can't do)-Comes already with Android 7.0 Nougat-Expandable storage via MicroSD Card.Cons:-Comes with 64GB of internal memory with no other options with more storage other than through the MicroSD card-No unlimited storage on the cloud for pictures and videos (like Google Pixel and Pixel XL)-Fingerprint in one of the worst places possible.-Sound not that great with only one speaker (not stereo)",4.0

854,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Beautiful phone with great functionalities and it is an incredible advancement from my old Samsung Galaxy Avant which is a great working phone, but it's been getting buggy in the last six months. I got mine through Fed Ex this morning so I will update my post in a few weeks but so far, I could not be happier. I got my phone from a different vendor out of Australia but shipped directly to me from Hong Kong, but I suspect it will be the same phone no matter when you buy it.My service provider is Metro PCS, which I am very happy to find out that I can keep and I took my phone to my local Metro PCS store and they got my phone working in less than 15 minutes. They explained the functions of the SIM slot #1 and #2 and how to insert a micro card. I had Metro add the International Calling plan to my phone for texting and calls from the U.S. I will use the SIM slot #2 for when I travel to France. Having a backup will help out.The style and glass front of the phone is very nice and it does not leave fingerprints. My old phone is the Samsung Galaxy Avant and I find that having my new phone is not difficult to re-learn. Some of the basic functions are the same.After getting home, I entered my passcode for my home wi-fi and the phone took it immediately and updated itself promptly. I also got the bluetooth function connected to my Fiat Sport 500c in less than five minutes. The batter powers up in no time to full and this morning, out of the box, my phone was at about 50% power. It took about 30 minutes to get it to 100%. So far, the battery tends to drain slowly.I read from another post of this phone that it did not have wi-fi. Not sure what happened, but this phone certainly does have it.The cord has a different end that plugs into the phone, so my old USB cords won't work however, the S8 box includes some attachments. One attachment is a small add-on that will fit on the small end of the USB cord so you can keep your old cords. The box also adds a connector so you can transfer files from one phone to another, or a computer to your phone and finally a 100-240 charging plug is included in the box, but it is not for European sockets nor American sockets. The two male connectors are slightly slanted so I suspect this is for Asia.I am not going to clone my Galaxy Avant software to my new phone because I want to begin fresh again. I will pick and choose each app but my Avant still works at home with my wi-fi and Magic Jack phone.There is only one slight disappointment; I expected the phone to be more of a gold tone color. The back of the phone is not really gold, but a slight gold tone with an odd color that seems to change color depending on the light available. Also, the front glass is gold tone once you pull up the apps, SMS, dialer, etc.I find this phone to be very advanced and a very good buy for the money I paid. It's basically a mini-computer and I use it for everything from driving, texting, phone, pictures, banking, buying, etc.This phone is definitely an incredible upgrade from my Avant and I am very pleased. I will update my post in a few weeks to a month.",5.0

I've never dropped this phone either. One minute it's fine and the next it's shattered. It was in my purse all day next to my cloth wallet. I never set my purse down nor did it get hit/leaned on/thrown/etc.. I pull out the phone and it's shattered. I'm so frustrated and angry that something this expensive would break for no apparent reason. TWICE. If I could give 0 stars, I would. This is absurd. I want my money back.",1.0

I am currently writing this review using a Bluetooth keyboard, and old fashioned wired USB mouse (connected with the Samsung includes USBC to USB connector), wired headphones, and smart link connection to a SmartBeam Laser projector.  so basically what I'm saying is that Samsung has achieved the desktop experience through a smartphone.  and all of this was set up in under 5 minutes on a Sunday morning.only criticizm I have, which has frustrated me for years with Samsung, is that the phone form factor is still too big.  yes, I knew this when I ordered it, but there's no other way to get all these features with a smaller screen.  maybe one day Samsung will make an iPhone SE Slayer in the S9 mini?",5.0
857,Amazon,Samsung S8,"I have progressed from the S6 through the S7 and now to the S8.The S8 is just OK compared to the S7 based on my experience.I REALLY do not like the fact that they took away the Home button.  It is so convenient to use it to activate the screen.  The current design is a kludge.The buttons for volume and for Bixby are almost directly opposite to the power button.  This is the worst design ever.  As a result, trying to turn off the screen is an extreme pain and usually results in a photo of my hand or activating Bixby or changing the volume.  My old iPhone had a good design, with the power button on top.  I'd have moved back to Apple, but can't stand the restrictions, like on managing music.The phone is a bit faster than the S7, but I have trouble with it responding to my touch.  That could be a symptom of the screen protector causing interference though.I am not a fan of the curved edges, preferring the flat screen.The display quality is great.The fingerprint scanner is inconvenient, but I knew that was the case going into this phone.",3.0

860,Amazon,Samsung S8,"This is a beautiful phone. I definitely wanted to experience something small but with a larger screen. A lot of people complain about the  location of the fingerprint scanner, which does  take some getting used to. But keep in mind that this is actually a natural position to place the scanner. Hold whatever phone you have in your hand and really think about where you place your fingers and how you are holding your device. See what I mean? I found this new location much more convenient than using the scanner with my thumb on the front of my phone.Unfortunately, there was something I couldn't get past with this particular model. The edges are more pronounced and cause a plastic-y looking glare when in the sunlight. I almost switched back to my iPhone 7 plus, but after using the S8 for a few days, it felt, and looked, old and clunky! If you are used to bigger phones, upgrade to the plus. If you've never had a super large phone, the s8 would be perfect for you!Also, please note that the orchid gray doesn't stand out as much indoors, as it appears much darker. When you're outside, the color stands out a lot more.Update: after spending 3-4 days with the s8 plus, I ended up switching back to the s8. The Verizon reps were super helfpul in assisting me throughout this process!",4.0
861,Amazon,Samsung S8,"This phone is amazing! 1st of all because it was unlocked and I already have metro PCS. I took it to them and they were easily able to get it set up. One TIP is that this come with a european plug, but all you have to do is go to the website and send an email explaining that you need an american attatchment and they will ship you one for free, I recieved two! This is what I sent them, ""Hello, I recently bought an international version of your unlocked Samsung Galaxy S8. It said to contact you if I was in need of a charger that fits American plugs. How do I go about getting one of these and how much are they from you?"" This is what they replied with, ""we will ship you USA plug for it free of charge."" All I did was click on seller information and put it in an ""ask a question."" As for the phone it is very smart and connects well with other devices, such as a smart TV especially a Samsung Smart TV. Bixby is the ""siri"" for this device and works great. It adjusts to your needs and even tells you people who you frequently contact at a certain time. This phone is easily customizable and the more you explore with it the more you will find. Battery life and speed of charging is also phenomenal.",5.0

863,Amazon,Samsung S8,"I preordered this phone, not knowing that it was an edge phone, since previous models of galaxies had the normal phones and edge phones separated. I was disappointed to see it was an edge phone since they're more susceptible to break, but I figured it was fine, and I got a case.One week after my phone arrived, it slipped from my lab, falling two feet to the stone floor, shattering my screen. Never in the past eight years have I ever cracked a screen, and I cracked the s8 within a week.Don't believe me? Look up stress tests for the s8, and you'll see it performs worse compared to previous phones.Pros:1. Nice camera2. Great battery life3. TONS of storage spaceCons:1. Breaks far too easily2. Fingerprint scanner not located in a convenient location, and it usually takes ~10 tries to get the phone to even recognize my fingerprint.3. The virtual home buttons disappear in some apps, making it annoying to try to close the app quickly.4. There is an extra button added to this phone below the volume buttons for something called ""Bixby"" which advertises itself as being some sort of virtual planner, providing the option to do an amazon search for something using image recognition. It's a cool concept, but I'm always pressing the button when I don't want to see it, and the image search feature is just a commercialized use of computer vision.",2.0

865,Amazon,Samsung S8,Don't listen to the other people reviews that say this phone is fake. This phone only works with GSM carriers if you live in the u.s. your GSM carriers would be AT&T and T-Mobile that means this phone will not work with Verizon or Sprint this phone is 100% real.

867,Amazon,Samsung S8,"For those of you that are consider buying this phone, let me mention some common variation of this phone:SM-G955F: International version, Samsung Exynos Processor (supposedly use less battery, last longer) , for GSM carriersSM-G955FD: International version, Duel Sim Card, Samsung Exynos Processor (supposedly use less battery, last longer) , for GSM carriersSM-G955U: US version, Snap Dragon Processor (supposedly better graphic support for gaming), I see people said the unlocked version support both GSM and CDMA carriers, but I do not have this version and have not verify this myself.Above are for S8+, S* is similar, part number replaced 955 with 950, with smaller screen and battery power.I used SM-G955FD:for about a month now, this is the most expensive phone I purchased.  Below is my list of pro and con.Pro:Decent Camera, good with low light environment.Great Battery life, 3500 amh, last longer then any other phone I had in the past.Support wireless charging, water-proof.Less overheating.  It gets warm when playing games while charging but never gets to point where it is too hot to hold.Con:Unusual Screen ratio.  Most game app do 16:9 screen ratio, this phone is thinner so when playing games, there are black boarder on both side and make it look smaller compare to other phone with same screen size in the market.  This also make it more difficult to type, I often press wrong key by accident due to spacing.Overall, I think this is a good phone.  Best Buy is offering a lot of promotion on this phone right now so you might wish to shop around before choosing where to buy it.",5.0
868,Amazon,Samsung S8,"I recently purchased this device not from amazon but from my local Verizon store (I am here to review the device not the seller) , replacing my old galaxy S6 edge. In the past week or so I have fallen in love with this phone the extra little features are awesome. the finger print scanner on the back of the phone was a bit weird to me at first but now that i have gotten a bit more used to it I think it is a nice change. making it easier to unlock your phone as you take it out of your pocket. all in all the device deserves a 4/5. i will explain the reason i think it should get a 4/5 and there is only one issue. If i could give the the device a 4.5 I would but that is not how amazon works.I have one single complaint. the dedicated Bixby button is probably the most annoying thing I have ever used. at first you could remap the button (i changed mine to the home key) but that change would be reverted within a day and you would then have to go remap the key again. just recently Samsung REMOVED the ability to do that because people were using google assistant instead of their own assistant Bixby. since the ability has been removed i ended up having to find an app that made it so i could disable all of the 6 packages that is Bixby. doing this removed all functionality of the dedicated button on the side of the device. It is really stupid to have a pointless button on the side of my phone, but at least i don't have to worry about accidentally pushing it and having an application that i do not want/ use show up on my screen.",4.0
869,Amazon,Samsung S8,"I tried so many ""flagship""phones that past year trying to replace my S6 edge! From Sony Xperia XZ to htc 10, until I found the Note 7, too bad it was recalled, went on the hunt again, or was it then that I got the XZ?, anyway ended up with the Google Pixel, which though very good, still felt like an unfinished product compared to the Note.Back to this S8 here. I'm gonna just mention the basics, coz I see so many in depth reviews here, so if ur confused about any phone compared to this one, feel free to comment on my review, I'll try to answer from experience!- The edge to edge screen is amazing, put it next to any phone out there and it stands out. I really can't stop looking at it because it's so sharp! Any picture, movie, YouTube video looks just better on this screen.- The camera is just great! While the pixel was advertised as the best camera on a phone, I still think this S8 is a little better.- Games and apps run fluently on this phone, no lags whatsoever, this phone will run anything u throw at, no sweat.- The size is just perfect, and the weight too!  It feels as big as my Google pixel but with twice the screen size (not exact measures if ur one of those! ) iWas gonna get the S8 plus, but felt it was oddly too tall and the width wasn't just adequate to the length, but the S8 is just the perfect size, easier with one hand too.-The battery is nothing special, I can say I'm an above average user and it lasts almost all day. Obviously when u play more or watch more Netflix, on that gorgeous screen, u'll need to charge it twice, but on most days I didn't need to.You'll not regret getting that phone, definitely the best on the market right now. I absolutely it love it and I think you will too!",5.0

872,Amazon,Samsung S8,"I have the phone for more than a month now, it's a beautiful phone, the display looks great, I can copy my photos and music and whatever I want freely to the computer and back unlike on an iPhone. The fingerprint sensor is on the back - not as comfy as the front facing old iPhone sensor but it's usable. it's not a one-hand phone it's a bit bigger than that and I have big hands. I love the pairing with the S3 Gear and the Samsung Health App. It has face unlock and fingerprint reader and passcode. I miss the dedicated silent button from the iPhone this needs to be UNLOCKED before I can silence it but there is a completely unnecessary Bixby button. There should be a silence button instead of that. The camera the iPhone camera is markedly better I'm sorry to say that but looking at the photos I took and I take now I can see it. Overall I think this is the best Android phone you can get I might also get an iPhone but not the X that is hideous with the notch the protruding camera and the glass back - maybe a 7 or 8.

874,Amazon,Samsung S8,"My first Android was a OnePlus One. Then, a One Plus Two. I have zero complaints about these two phones.The screen on my OP2 cracked, so I decided to splurge and got myself this beauty. In retrospect, I should have just repaired my OP2's screen. The S8 was an absolute (and expensive) disappointment.It gives you gimmicky features such as the iris-scan, the heart-rate monitor, edge-lighting, which are honestly a bit useless, in my opinion. The curved screen, while a novelty, is incredibly pointless, and in fact creates glare at the edges which makes it very hard to see notifications when the phone is mounted in your car.A lot of people are annoyed about the finger-print scanner's location. It's not ideal, but I've tolerated it and it seems to work okay for me.Android purists will not be happy with the fact that Samsung tries to force their ""Google Now"" clone called ""Bixby"" onto the user. It is a complete reinvention of the wheel and does not work nearly as well as ""Google Now"" does. They have even dedicated a button to this abomination and have made sure that it cannot be re-mapped to do anything else. a truly annoying restriction on the user who paid a lot of money to have a customizable phone - Otherwise, I would have gotten an Iphone, had I wanted to be locked into a certain way of doing things.Some very common widgets (Such as Google Keep) simply don't display correctly on this phone. They display perfectly fine on other Android phones, but not on this, possibly due to the aspect ratio.The all-white theme that is forced upon the user is not only an eye-sore, it makes notifications indistinguishable from one another.Ultimately, the phone is nothing more than a status symbol and yes, it's pretty. The display and camera are nice, but that's not something lacking in most modern phones. Please save your money and get something else.",2.0

Bought S8 and I had to say it is the worst Galaxy I've owned.The main issue is screen that cracks SO easily. I didn't even drop the phone, I sat down and it was in my pocket, and the little bump of the phone caused the screen to crack. In a few more days I got a few more cracks. There is absolutely no value in the ""infinity"" screen, it's beautiful but worthless. In my 8 years of owning multiple Galaxies I only cracked the screen once, and I dropped it many times. S8 has a design flaw.Then there's Samsung bloatware that annoys the hell out of you. Bixby is useless but you can't disable it. It wakes up when a button is pressed accidentally in your pocket and it starts making noises, sometimes launching apps...

Shame on Samsung for not having it ready by release and also for not letting you re-map the Bixby button to something else.. The Battery is O.K. but not great and for the money  I think the phone should have 6Gs of RAM. Screen resolution automatically being set to the lower resolution tells me that Samsung might still be a little gun shy because of what happened to the Note 7.All in all I really like this phone but if you haven't got it yet you might want to wait to see what Bixby is really like, that is if that sort of thing is important to you.**6/2/17 **I had to come back to this and drop a star fro this review because as of today Samsung still is not able to get Bixby up and running in the U.S. I mean what good is a voice assistant device with no voice!!!

Unfortunately it happened to me just as it apparently has happened to many other users (if you google galaxy s8 cracked screen, you will find many results)So even though all the rest of the phone is outstanding, I would never ever buy it again as it will not even last even a month. My biggest concern is that repairing a cracked screen costs 200-300 USD and that I know I would have to repair it again just a few weeks later.Of course, I have tried to be very careful, but due to the full glass body of the phone, it is extremely slippery and will slip out your pocket and fall of any surface very quickly and easily.I have been a faithful Samsung customer for many years, but unfortunately I will probably not have a choice but need to look for a high end smartphone of LG, Sony or HTC now.PS: The stunning Edge-Glass-Infinity-Screen design is the cause of this deal braking problem.

If I liked the phone more, I might try to jump through additional hoops but it's really not particularly good. Okay, but not great.

991,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Note: I am reviewing this phone based on its quality and functionality, and it's full suggested retail price of $750, and not based on price-gouging from these third-party re-sellers.A quick prologue: I had been laying low since buying two Samsung Galaxy S6 Edges in early 2015 (one gold, one white - yes, I loved it that much). I knew that it was the perfect phone for me at that time, and that based on how the cell phone evolution was going on then (early 2015), I knew the S7 Edge would be an iterative succession, and not a big leap forward. So I bought my S6 Edges with the thought in mind that I would have it for at least 2-3 years. My analysis was that Samsung at that point in time had plateaued their curved screen technology and philosophy, and would move on next to foldable screens by 2020. I gave them a couple of buffer years in case they didn't feel like introducing us to such drastic technology too early, as Samsung has a habit of forward thinking, yet holding back a year or two so they can milk the most money out of their current technologies. Fast forward to this year, and I have not been wrong - Samsung has indeed matured and plateaued its curved screen plans, but their foldable screen technology has not been up to speed, so it would be delayed for another year or two (they are still on track for 2020). With the introduction and quick adoption/popularity of HDR technology, they can afford to stay on their curved screen plan for another year or two until they lower the costs of their foldable screen technology down enough for mass production.I loved my S6 Edges, but I got bored of the gold one quickly, and sold it to buy a Rose Gold iPhone 6S last year, while keeping the white S6 Edge. I loved everything about it - mainly the beautiful curved screen design, but even more so, the awesome camera, which was the best for its time, and still holds up today as one of the very best in bright light. If you go through my reviews, 99% of the photos from 2015 on are from my S6 Edge. It is so good I have replaced my travel DSLR with it (I still use my Canon 5D Mark III for my serious projects), and all my Instagram photos are also from my S6 Edge (you can find the link to my IG on my Amazon profile).Sorry for the long intro, but it ties to my review that the camera on the S8 is even better. Do not be fooled by early hands-on articles that the rear camera is the same as the S7 Edge. It is NOT the same. It is a new camera system developed by Sony, and it is a dual-pixel system which takes two photos each time you press the shutter button, and quickly and deftly combines the two to give you an awesome final photo, which contains HDR and selective focus elements/photo modes. It excels in low light conditions, with its f1.7 aperature, and it even exceeds the S7 Edge's camera. It might not compete in fast action with the ridiculous 960 fps Sony camera in its new Xperia X phones, but for everyday use, I feel this is the best phone camera so far. It has electronic image stabilization (EIS), even up to 4K video recording, which is a first for phone cameras. The front (selfie) camera is also vastly improved, but not as good as the 13MP camera of the LG G6.This is a photography geek's review, leading in with the camera, but I know most of you are more concerned with the big beautiful screen, which it is exactly that. The resolution is 2960 x 1440 pixels, or a pixel density of 570 ppi. The technology is Samsung's very own OLED, called sAMOLED. It is the same basic technology that makes the best TV screens in LG's OLED TVs. Samsung's 2017 version is so good, it is apparently the best screen ever. You can read more technical specs from Display Mate:displaymate. com/Galaxy_S8_ShootOut_01.htm (erase the space between the dot com)How Samsung has managed to squeeze all that goodness into a phone this size is quite a technological marvel, and quite a gamble as well. Instead of the 16:9 ratio 95% of the phones out there today have, they have chosen on a 18:5.9 ratio, which just sounds really weird. This is pretty much a 3:1 ratio, which is quite unheard of. Even LG's unique G6 phone has a different 18:9 (or 2:1) ratio. So this is Samsung's way of truly trying to stand out from the crowd for this generation (year). I really don't know why they chose this ratio, as even cinema (movie theatre) ratio is 21:9, so there truly is no video/film format that perfectly fits this screen's ratio. So there will be empty spaces around the videos and movies you watch, but the black bezels will help eliminate that disparity - note that all S8's, regardless of what color scheme, have black front bezels.This phone is actually more narrow than the S6/S6 Edge. The S8 measures 68.1mm wide by 8.1mm thick by 148.9mm tall, and weighs 155 grams, while the S6 Edge is 70.1 x 7 x 142.1 mm, and weighs 132 g. But as you can see it is a tick thicker, and noticeable taller and heavier. So although the S8 has a total footprint that is larger than the S6 Edge, or is actually easier and more comfortable to hold in one hand. For further comparisons, the iPhone 7 is 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1 mm (138 g), the iPhone 7 Plus is 158.2 x 77.9 x 7.3 mm (188 g), and the LG G6 is 148.9 x 71.9 x 7.9 mm (163 g). So it actually is easier to grasp in the hand than most other phones of similar size, only bested by the (much smaller) iPhone 7 (4.7-inch screen vs. 5.8-inch for the S8).The sound systems are also improved, as the speaker is louder and more clear, and the audio processing is much much better for listening to music with your earphones/headphones. However, it is still a mono speaker, not even stereo-immersive sound, and of course nowhere near as good as HTC's usual dual-speakers. Speaking of earphones, a pair of premium AKG earphones are included, which is the best factory-bundled earphones I have witnessed. It cannot compare to my Velodynes and Sennheisers, but it beats all other cheap generic bundled earphones. That reminds me, you should spend the extra $100 on the extra bundle, which in addition to the included VR headset, also includes a Samsun 256GB microSD card, and a pair of AKG Bluetooth headphones. Each sells for over $100, so you are actually saving a bunch: AKG Bluetooth Headphone Black (Y50BTBLK) Samsung EVO+ 256GB UHS-I microSDXC U3 Memory Card with Adapter (MB-MC256DA/AM).My S6 Edge worked fluidly and flawlessly in the first few month. But even with the top processor of the time, and 3GB of RAM, it slowed down as the memory neared the capacity, especially after the hundreds of photos began to pile up. The camera, once near instantaneous to turn on, now takes about a second. The S8, with its 4GB of RAM and either the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor or Samsung's own Exynos 8895 so far is doing an impeccable job. The Snapdragon 821, and even the 820, is fast enough for 2017, so having the 835 and the Exynos 8895 future-proofs it for another 2-3 years at least, since I feel with each successive processor, we are getting to the point where the hardware requirements for software is plateauing, and you would only need the latest processors for video games which keeps getting better and better and continually needs the fastest processor. I think once we reach 6GB of RAM, any processor beyond the 835/8895 should be fast enough for every day apps of the next 10 years.In totality, this is the first phone since the S6 Edge that I got really excited about, and with the rumored OLED iPhone coming out this year, 2017 should be a great year for fans of both sides to upgrade. If you don't mind the $750+ price, you can't go wrong with the Samsung Galaxy S8. It is an investment that should last a few years, or at least until those foldable screen phones come out....",5.0

The side bar app thing they show as a selling point is also pointless, it's another stupid feature they add to make this phone ""look"" like they've added something new from the older phones. But in reality it's just the same as having certain apps in a folder on your wallpaper.

1123,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Okay. First one broke second day of use, RIGHT in the morning! First drop, concrete, shattered - and one small crack = dead phone. Because the darn thing is needlessly ENTIRELY GLASS, and virtually NO edges, any cracks splinter across the whole phone. Cracks in the middle (mine was ONLY on the right ""infinity"" edge area) cripple all touch sensors above the middle, so I could only dial numbers, not use the keypad even trying to get the phone fixed.The insurance company REFUSES to replace these; they found every excuse to prevent me getting a replacement for 10 DAYS! I demanded Sprint make it right, but, as nice as Sprint support is, the insurance company they use is a bag of D's. RUDE! They even accused me in the end of phone insurance fraud. WTF!? So I left Sprint for T-Mobile on principal and paid the remaining $700 balance for the STILL DEAD PHONE.Second phone (first with TMobile) survived about a week and a half. It was about the second drop, just about 2 feet off the ground IN A PROTECTIVE CASE! Looking at it right now. I knew all phone carriers have the same insurance, so I've decided to just get a Samsung J7; basically a Note 4 without the stylus. Since I'm looking at my Note 4, which as slight scratches on the screen, and some metal ripped off the side from drops, it still works perfectly, I'm glad to have a cheaper phone I don't mind so much  breaking, and will eventually file a claim with TMobile, once I can stomach the concept of dealing with that insurance company again.I love Samsung, but I HATE this phone! It's only brought me misery, and $1400 dollars down the toilet.Also, side note, no current phone repair places can fix this, because of the ""inifinity"" screen junk,",1.0

1152,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Already knew the S8+ and loved it. I ordered this to replace one I broke. This came in awesome condition. I'm subtracting 2 stars because it did NOT have the latest update as advertised and for that reason it initially did not want to set up with my TMobile sim. It kept complaining that it wasn't Verizon and wanted to be in ""global"" mode. When it would connect, it was so slow it was unusable. I figured out the solution though. I stuck a Verizon sim from my work phone(you could also just be on wifi, but Verizon prioritized the updates pushed to it), let it do all the updates and then put my TMobile sim in. Then it detected it was TMobile, cleared out the crappy Verizon bloatware and everything is fine! Hope this helps others having issues.Seller should include this info as well as actually do full updates after factory reset as advertised.",3.0
1153,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Can't really imagine a way this could have been much better. The phone shipped in a box. Not original packaging, but something nice just to keep it safe and whatever. The phone looks like the screen was replaced because it had a protective plastic over it which very easialy peeled off to reveal a phone in flawless condition. From front to back, bezel to bezel. There was barely a trace of anything that would indicate the phone was pre-owned. I felt like I got very lucky with my purchase.This is the third refurbished/ pre-owned phone I've bought and it follows the trend of having a charger and a cable (usually one which seems used and not in great condition) My cable was slightly nicer than the ones I got with other phones but I'm sure that's just by chance. It was still obviously a used cable which had issues keeping a solid connection to my computer. Again, I think all these companies do this so I don't think it's the end of the world. The actual wall charger is an official Samsung one and that was basically the reason this wasn't a 4 star review. Even though the cable isn't very good, the phone charges quickly which is the whole point.This also came with a key to open the sim slot. Since the phone had some power when it was shipped, I had this Verizon phone making calls on ATT in about 30 minutes from the time I opened the box.I really feel like these guys are trying to be competitive in how they ship and present their products as well as what kind of accessories they come with. I will definitely look for these guys the next time I need a phone.",5.0

I went to a different metro pcs store and was helped right away and walked out with the phone connected. My advice would be to tell the workers its unlocked and that the phone is fully paid off. Most of the workers there are kinda lazy and tend not to care at all if its not a phone from their carrier.,5.0

I feel that it has to do a lot with this push to use Bixby but that no excuse to have worse performance. BTW the phone I upgraded from was the Samsung Galaxy Note 3(a phone from 2013).

1160,Amazon,Samsung S8,"This review is coming from someone that is rather biased so take it as you will, but there are some points I want to bring up that hopefully you'll all consider. The reason I say I'm biased is because I enjoy using compact phones (4.7 inches) and it was an inconvenience to try to use this phone. There were three main issues that I had with this phone and that was the first one. Along with that, the aspect ratio is just awkward and it was weird to try to watch movies on the screen. The second issue I had is the fact that you can't put a screen protector on this phone without losing the phones receptiveness to touch. This is something that I had no idea about before I actually purchased the phone - no major reviewer talked about it. But as soon as I had a tempered glass screen protector installed, I had to tap the screen an average of about five times before it would register my touch. First I installed a screen protector myself from Amazon and it had that issue, and I thought it was just that specific screen protector, so I went to the mall and got one installed from a professional. It had the same issues. Also, it defeats the purpose of having an edge to edge curved screen if you want to use a case. So really this is a great phone for someone that's fine with not protecting their phone, but for me, someone that needs to protect their investment, the fear of dropping the phone was unbearable. The last issue I had with this phone is the fact that it was having issues with certain apps crashing and not being able to use some apps - most likely due to the fact that the phone is refurbished. For example, I was able to get my banking app set up just fine the first day, then the next day, and all the following days, it would crash immediately after opening it. There were some other apps that did that as well like some games and online dating apps. For me that was the last straw and I ended up returning the phone. It was also very hard to get in touch with the seller themselves over the phone because they have to actually pick up the phone and if they don't you have to leave a voicemail, unlike how most phone systems are set up where if you call you'll get someone on the phone eventually if you stay on the line. Out of the about twenty times I tried to get in touch with them, they only picked up once. When I finally did get on the phone with someone from BuySpry, she seemed very disinterested in talking to me and didn't seem to care about my concerns. I myself work in a customer support job, and if one of my co-workers acted like that, they would eventually end up getting fired. The good news however is that if you send them an email it only takes them about a day to respond. The only reason I gave this two stars instead of one stars is because I was able to get a full refund after I returned the phone. As a last thought with this review, do yourself a favor: if you want to buy a flagship phone, don't buy it refurbished. If you buy it refurbished, it comes with the risk of having software issues like mine did, and you essentially get half the life of a brand new phone. So really you're getting maybe $100 off to have a worse battery life, about half a lifespan of the phone itself, and a risk of software issues. I would easily pay an extra $100 to not have those issues. You owe it to yourself to buy a phone new if you're going to buy a flagship.",2.0
1161,Amazon,Samsung S8,"This went way better than I had expected. The phone was in a pristine state. There was a little instruction card to get me started with the setup, which was helpful because that can be a little different than for a boxed phone. A google search helped with other queries, like how to start the system update check etc.There was a white charger in the box, and no other accessories. (the value of these would be no more than 10-12 dollars even at retail prices).So ultimately, I got a beautiful like-new phone, at a hefty discount, that pretty much meant I got an S8 at the price of a Oneplus 5.

1170,Amazon,Samsung S8,"If you bought a Samsung S8+, you now have Bixby, a piece of bloatware written by a group of teenagers tasked by Samsung with imitating Google Now, Alexa, Cortana, and Siri. The result is absolutely catastrophic and reminds of Word 1.0 (if you are old enough). The software still does not recognize voice – no, it’s not just because of my accent – making it perfectly useless.The catch is that this “assistant” – which would be called Jar Jar Binks if it was from a galaxy far far away – is tied to a side button. As soon as the S8 was released, people came up with Google Play applications to remap this button or to disable the software altogether. Samsung retaliated by releasing an update to prevent the hack from working. It lasted for a week until a clever developer found a countermeasure.One million people have downloaded one of the anti-Bixby programs on Google Play. The other Samsung S8 users are probably trying to figure how to do it, I guess. Well done, Samsung! You have released another Galaxy Note 7...So, I will now give you a way to BOTH disable the pathetic Bixby AND remap the button.1. Download “Package Disabler Pro”2. Search for the Bixby software in ""Package Disabler Pro"" and disable all EXCEPT Bixby Home and Bixby Voice. They will be rendered harmless without the services except that they detect the button press and raise an event. You can disable the rest of the Samsung bloatware while you’re at it.3. Install the BxAction software from Google Play4. The BxAction software detects the raised event from step 2 and it will be able to start another app.5. Map the button to something useful like Google Now (which is a piece of software that actually does what Samsung advertises Bixby for...)",5.0

WARRANTY IS ONLY VALID IN THE U.S.!!!, Samsung it's not like Apple, Samsung warranty is local on phones so forget it you think Samsung will accept your warranty elsewhere. I went to Samsung Colombia and their preliminary analysis is that they are not sure if the problem is with the camera (70% probability) or the board.  At this time I have not yet decided if sending  the phone to US for warranty or take it to Samsung Colombia at my own expense. If the hardware problem is with the camera, the replacement will cost me like US$100-150.  Because I saved US$350  buying the phone in US,  it still makes a good deal and the camera replacement will give me a year of warranty on phone's camera in Colombia.Beware because this ""Warning Camera Fail"" error its a very commune HARDWARE issue on the S8/S8+ models. I have bough several Samsung phones, they are excellent and will buy Samsung again...

1184,Amazon,Samsung S8,"I have this Galaxy S8+ working under the Cricket carrier.The fingerprint scanner on the back is a non-issue.  It took me no time to become accustomed to it.  Using it is even easier after putting a case on the phone.The S8+ is noticeably better than the S7 and can handle anything you throw at it.  It is a beast at multi-tasking.  If only apps were as well designed as this phone, it's annoying when they crash or freeze because of imperfections in their coding.  If you have problems with apps glitching or crashing, it's the app, not this powerful phone that can stand toe-to-toe with desktop computers.UPDATE July 4, 2017:I no longer have this phone, it went defective on me.Exactly a month after buying it, the screen blacked out while I was laying on the couch watching a Twitter video. Everything was responsive, the screen just wouldn't light up. I ended up returning it just in time. Now I have the Galaxy S7 again. If you get this expensive phone, you should get some type of insurance on it.  This expensive phone taught me that no phone is safe from defects. This one comes with a one-year warranty, but I don't know how thorough it is. When you get the phone, you have a certain amount of time to sign up with Samsung Premium Care. I think Amazon has an insurance package too so you should compare both of them before choosing either of them.Now that I'm back on the Galaxy S7, I'm reminded of how this phone is a still a beast too.",5.0

I'll never buy a Samsung phone again and I wish I bought another Google phone - pure Android, no junk apps.Bixby, Samsung's answer to OK Google, Alexa or Siri is the worst AI.  It's constantly prompting you and can never respond to your simple requests.  ""I'm sorry but I cannot do that"" is its response to most every routine request.  The auto-correct is obnoxious and changes words without warning.  The phone is also constantly trying to teach you how to use it by popping up tutorials you cannot close without completing.  Sorry but I've used a camera before I don't need forced tutorials.  And you cannot turn any of this off.  Bixby is there to sell you things so enjoy paying $750 for high pressure sales.  I could go on and on but I think you get the point.I really regret this purchase.",1.0
1187,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Overall the Galaxy S8 is an excellent smartphone that competes and often one ups other current flagship phones (Google Pixel, iPhone).  Ultimately a few odd design decisions keep this from achieving a full 5 star review from me.PROS-The best looking screen on any mass market phone ever produced-Excellent camera performance-Lighter version of Touchwiz (Samsung OS) including the ability to disable and uninstall bloatware-Not too big to hold (a bit long though)-Solid battery performanceCONS-Odd positioning of a dedicated button for ""Bixby"" Samsung's assistant software.  This button is far too close to the volume down button and I hit it constantly by accident.  Worse yet, it can't be disabled without downloading a third party app.  Even worse, Bixby itself is not anywhere near as useful as Google assistant.  Samsung...PLEASE stop messing with software.  Leave Google alone, this is their core business competency and your incessant layering on of useless features (now coming with a dedicated button) is obscene.  This design flaw will ultimately drive me to a Google Pixel upon their next release (most likely Fall 2017).-Odd positioning of the fingerprint sensor.  Way too far up on the phone which makes it hard to reach, right next to the camera lens.  Bad design.-Fragile glass.  I dropped it from between knee and waist height one time and the glass cracked.  If you buy, you must invest in a screen protector.Ultimately if you can deal with the annoyances listed above you should have no reservations buying this phone.  The screen itself is worth the investment.  Every time I show someone a photo on my camera they comment on how good it looks.  Here's to hoping Samsung scratches the Bixby button, embeds the finger print reader in the screen, and offers a pure Android version.  That to me would be the perfect phone.",4.0
1188,Amazon,Samsung S8,"My wife and I have had the Samsung S8+ for a little over a week now. I am an avid Samsung Galaxy user, and have been using them since the 4th generation. Here are the pros and cons as I see them to this device.Pros:- Android Nougat is a very smooth OS. It's a definite upgrade from the previous versions. Just keeps getting better.- The cameras on this phone are both amazing. Makes great photos!- Very slick design on phone, aesthetically speaking. It looks very nice.- Comes with a nice variety of accessories, including adapters for charging in case you want to use a micro-USB charger or want to hook up a USB cable accessory for any reason.- Extremely good graphics on this device. Resolution is phenomenal.- Wide range of settings for customizing your user experience and security. (Even more than the usual for an Android/Samsung device)- Continued to allow for external storage, unlike the S6, which made me very happy.- I haven't put the water resistance to the test, but I'm assuming it's as good as the last model. Glad it's there.- The full screen layout is very nice for movies and gaming. I adjusted to the homescreen button being part of the screen almost instantly.Cons:- This is an EXTREMELY fragile design, especially the back of the phone, which is also coated in the Gorilla Glass, from what I can tell. My wife dropped hers from about 10 inches, with a case on, on the 5th day of ownership. The back of the phone cracked, chipped, and spider-webed all over within just a few hours. The phone was insured through our carrier, but the cheapest solution was to send it in to Samsung for a $75 repair job (plus shipping and handling). I would strongly recommend using a reputable case and screen protector at all costs. And be sure you insure this device. Lots of the durability tests that I have seen on YouTube have exposed this design flaw as well.- The headphones that come with the phone aren't that great. In previous editions, they provided Samsung-brand headphones that sounded great. It looks like they've started using another company to produce their headphones. There is very little bass or mid-range in the sound, so if you use your headphones for music, gaming, or videos, be prepared to get a better brand.- The new Bixby application via Samsung... I'm still trying to adjust to it. It's Samsung's version of Google Assistant/Siri. It's not that it's not a useful concept, but you don't get much of a choice but to use it. There's a dedicated button on the left of the phone that can not be deactivated from what I can tell. It's right below the volume button and is easy to press unknowingly and can get annoying quickly. I hope Bixby grows on me.- The voice command features for both Google and Bixby is weak in this edition. I have had to reprogram my voice recognition settings about 5 times already, and it still only picks up the commands about 30% of the time. Oddly enough, it works much better for the Bixby service than the Google Assistant service. (That struck me as a bit suspicious)- The speech-to-text application in general took a step backwards with this edition. My S7 and S6 both did a wonderful job for the most part of translating my speech. This phone, however, has massive errors in its translation. It hyphenates words that don't need to be and substitutes words incorrectly, and often. I have to speak EXTREMELY slowly and phonetically in order to get it to work. The fact that I have a Southern accent doesn't help whatsoever. This was one of the worst drawbacks for me, personally, because I use the speech-to-text feature often with my work.Overall: It's a gorgeous phone with some definite upgrades but concerning drawbacks. If I were Samsung, I would put a lot of emphasis on making a more durable design on the future editions. Worth buying - just keep it well protected.",3.0
1189,Amazon,Samsung S8,"I pre ordered my Samsung S8 and received on April 20,2017 from AT&T. I really liked the look and the screen was wonderful. But I have an issue and it is a buyer beware thing. This phone has gorilla glass 5 on it which is suppose to be the best. The other day I had my phone in my front pocket and bent down. the phone dropped out and landed on the ground face down. Now it was only 10""-12"" from the ground and when it occurred I said, ""damn"" to myself but remembered it had gorilla glass 5 on it so not a problem. Later on looking at the phone I saw a scratch and on further inspection it revealed a crack that went across the phone 3 ways. I have had a Samsung 4 and 6 and never had a problem with a screen when they dropped before. So beware for the gorilla glass is not all cracked up to what they are saying.

1192,Amazon,Samsung S8,"This looks like a great phone at first. After only a few weeks, I realized that I made a huge mistake to give Samsung a third chance (after owning a washer/dryer that died after only 4 years and a TV that came apart and had to be exchanged for a Sony TV after less than a week).First, Samsung's bloatware really ruins the experience. However, with sweat, blood, and tears you can remove most of it. You can even disable Bixby and turn your Galaxy S8+ into the first phone with a non-functional hardware button. However, you cannot have hands-free Google Assistant, even though Samsung advertises this feature.Second, the hardware is fragile. I had my phone in a Samsung case since day one and it still managed to get a deep long scratch on the back. I didn't drop it. It was never outside the case. It was not a third-party case. I'm not a savage. For example, I've never scratched any of my previous iPhones in the span of nearly a decade.Third, don't bother paying for or seeking support. You'll first talk to support that turns out to be volunteers, yet it is made to look like official Samsung support. Then you're given a phone number to call support and ten minutes into the call they mention Premium Support. You then respond with... ""Wait, your not Premium Support"" and they give you yet another number to call. So, you call Premium Support, which costs $288 for 2 years by the way, and are told that you have to pay the $99 deductible even in this case. I then learn that I'm actually talking to someone from Assurant who has zero flexibility. They tell me that they can connect me with Premium Support though. After several minutes I learn that there actually is no other Premium Support entity and that you're really just dealing with an inflexible insurance and that Samsung doesn't stand behind their products.I understand that there are a deductible and fine print but Samsung should also understand that I only do business with companies that stand behind the quality of their products. I didn't drop the phone or use it without a case. I used it with a Samsung case that ended up causing a scratch on the supposedly ultrastrong glass back. If it weren't for Apple's lackluster iPhone releases in the past 3 years I would've never given them a third chance. There will absolutely not be a fourth chance.You'll see this phone on Craigslist very soon and I'll be returning all my Samsung accessories over the weekend.",2.0

The first thing I did is remove the auto updates on all of the apps I didn't want or need in the first place. Too bad I can't remove them.Ring tone defaults are weird and that's the second thing to fix. You also will have to set everything up so you are able to get your MMS messages since the phone comes unlocked, but I expected that.The screen is beautiful. Once I have it in a case, it's much larger than I expected, which is a good and bad thing. Sound quality has been good so far, but I typically talk through a Bluetooth (either headset or car speakers).One thing I did not realize is that this phone does not charge with the standard micro USB. It is not as inconvenient as I first thought because the adapters are readily available and cheap, so I'm just ordering several of them. I'll also give the wireless charger a try.I do think I'll learn to love this phone in time once I get used to all of the Samsung quirks again.Pros: Great picture, and easy to read/work on documents for work.

1203,Amazon,Samsung S8,"This phone is absolutely beautiful to hold and it has a sleek, 'new-car' feeling!Over all the functionality is similarly comparable across the Galaxy phones (4/7edge) with exception to few obvious changes (upgrades?) to the phone.  In the quest for the slick, they opted to take away the 'Home' button, which my fingers - as well as other iPhone/Galaxy users - have gotten subconsciously programmed to press, only to find that there are no buttons. I would need to 'swipe up' from the bottom of the screen and a virtual 'Home’ button, 'back' function and 'multi-window' interface becomes accessible.This phone has a Samsung Note8-esque interface (not to mention, the screen size difference between those two is just 0.1 inch!). So outside of the Stylus, S8+ promises to be just as versatile in its use!  One other function they did away with - because of the ‘Home’ button change - I have to use the Volume down+Power button to take a screenshot.  Using my thumb+middle finger to squeeze a shot may get some getting used to!The 3500mAh Battery holds well through the day (I use it heavily and I only seem to be down to about 35% by dinner time) and the only thing that seems to 'overheat' the product and/or shorten the battery life is when I am using it with VR.When I first had the Samsung S4, I was able to capture image of a beautiful low-light sunset (for which I was selected winner for a photography submission) and ever since then I’ve been HOOKED!  I took a photo of another sunset! This one was taken without any special filter and yet it beautifully captures the layers of the fading colors - S8+ exceeds it’s low-light capabilities of it's predecessors!  In addition, there are some new photo functions (swipe left in ‘Camera’). I love that as an inner (or Yelp) ‘Foodies’, I have my very own food filter to snap as many lunch or dinners as I pleased!  Use the 'Pro' function and I am Wow'd with the filter package it comes with!Getting an unlocked phone will give me the freedom to choose mobile network not just in the US but Internationally - which is great, as an international photographer to travel with and it sure beats carrying around multi handsets!  As an unlocked phone, this Samsung S8+ has both CDMA and GSM capabilities.  I went with a CDMA network, and the company blocked my ‘Talk and Surf’ function. On the bright side, CDMA does seem to preserve the battery life better so it’s a toss up!As the saying goes, ya either will Love it or Hate it, like Kimchee.

1207,Amazon,Samsung S8,"BUYER BEWARE:The Galaxy S8 and S8+ has extremely fragile glass.  There have been many metric tests that have shown the glass to be very vulnerable to cracking, not good for a all-glass phone.  The SquareTrade testing resulted in the worst performing glass they have ever tested.My wife and I are big Galaxy fans, and pre-ordered the phones even with the Note7 issues.  We loved the phones until last weekend when both phones ended up with cracks on the edge screens.  There were no drops, or collisions, or any single event we could point to for how these cracks happened.  Our best guess is the cracks were from being in our pockets (also the cracks are from tensional forces, not impact), and we weren't playing basketball or wrestling, simple walking around town and at home.  It was the fact we were so gentle with these phones that has us dumbfounded.  It was after this when I researched and found they very poor performances in reliability testing on the S8 glass.My wife's phone crack originated from the interface between the edge screen glass and the Bixby button, her screen is unresponsive in an isolated area around that crack.  My phone's crack is originated from the bottom-right corner, and the entire screen now is unresponsive.  I cannot unlock the phone or even power the phone down.I contacted Samsung, and just like how they handled the Note7 batteries at first, they are not taking ownership of the issue and blaming the failures on the consumers.  Even though the Samsung warranty rep I spoke with slipped and stated that they were receiving a lot of reports of cracks that customers claim were not from any impact/drops.  Still they are taking the blanket stance that any screen cracks are user caused and voids the warranty, not taking into account all the real metrics showing the glass to be fragile and it's actually manufacturer defect.  I owned a S4, S5, S6, and S7 with no issues of screen cracks.Regardless, I'm sharing my experience and warning anyone thinking about buying the phone.  FYI, my wife had the Spigen Liquid Crystal Galaxy S8 Case and Zagg Tempered Glass, I had only the Zagg Tempered glass.  The cracks actually occurred under the Zagg glass, which the Zagg glass on both phones are crack-free.",1.0

1210,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Screen quality is great. Battery life is nearly impossible to kill in a 8 hour shift with heavy use. Curved screen is unnecessary and sometimes while holding the phone to watch a video you may mess with the screen accidentally on the edges. Speaker is in a terrible spot speaking of holding the phone sideways to watch videos your finger will cover the speaker. Dropped it once and the corner shattered, really disappointing. I think the one thing that has really bothered me the most was the keyboard/word prediction. It seems to not know English very well and corrects you with odd words or is somewhat difficult to customize properly. I had to download a different keyboard that is probably equally as annoying any way. Best thing is the secure folder with fingerprint or Iris lock capabilities I believe, fingerprint for sure. Secret web browsing mode as well. Hide certain apps/images/folders you name it pretty much. Don't know if I would actually recommend.

Also, the almost border less design is great. No problems at all with accidental touches or anything. Works amazing.Next is the camera, best in the business really. Beautiful and highly customizable. Even has all kinds of filters and Snapchat like add ons. 12MP is still great.The battery is good as well. While battery tech is still paltry in any phone, the s8+ does surprisingly well with its massive screen. I get about a days worth (8 hours screen on time) with one charge. Pretty decent. And let's talk about the fast charge, 2nd fastest behind OnePlus only taking just under 90 minutes from 0 to 100. It's fast.As a phone, this thing can do and okay anything. Any task is doable with this phone. It has the latest Snapdragon 835 processor, for the best performance and battery life.

1237,Amazon,Samsung S8,"The Last Samsung Product I Will Ever Purchase!Prior to this terrible warrantee experience I am having I liked Samsung products. I have several in my home. However, when something goes wrong and you need to send the product in for service and repair, good luck!I purchased a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge earlier in the year after being a loyal iPhone user since the 3GS. When I made the switch I was pleasantly surprised how much I liked the phone. It worked flawlessly for about six months until a firmware update they release trashed the phone. Took it to a local Samsung rep. at Best Buy and he tried for a day and a half to replace the operating system with no luck. He said that it is still under warranty so send it in and they’ll fix it. Sounded great, however.I called their customer service number and they stared a claim, she took my information down and told me it will take around eleven days to get it back, then issued me a UPS label. I sent the phone off to them and they send me an email on June 27th confirming that they received the phone and issued me a ticket number. So far so good right?Well after the first week when by I decided to check the status of my repair through the Repair Self Tracking portal they have and was surprised to see that there was nothing in their system about my repair claim. Though to myself, that’s weird.On July 13th, after thirteen business days later of not hearing anything I called them again to check the status. They said that they were done with it but I gave them a P.O. Box address and that they can only delver to a physical address. Oh, ok I get it, a mistake. However, when the person who originally took my information shouldn’t she have told me that they required a physical address? Still, not too upset. They told me that they would ship it immediately and I would have it in 1-4 business days. Great? Not so fast.Five business days later on July 20th I still had not received my phone so I called again. The Samsung rep I talked to this time said pretty much the same thing that the last rep told me and that it has not been shipped. Now I’m irritated. I told him that they had the correct address now so what’s the problem?  He put me on hold and checked with the repair shop and a Anne told him that they would overnight it today and I would receive it tomorrow. This is where it gets really shady. I asked this person to please send me an email stating our conversation and confirming that the phone was being shipped overnight. He told me that they do not have the capability to send emails. What? Samsung can’t send emails? I was pissed off so I asked to speak to his supervisor. He put me on hold for a really long time and came back to tell me that his supervisor “Graham” will not speak with me and that he doesn’t have the capability to send an email either. Now I’m furious. I’m being lied to and this is getting really shady. I’m not sure they even have my phone at this point. He put me on hold again and talked to Anne again who told him that when they sip it later today, I would receive an email stating that it shipped. I was not happy and expressed it vividly.I then went on the web trying to find another number to contact or call someone above them all with no luck. So what I found is that if these people want to screw you over, there’s no one else to get involved or help. What a predicament.Later the same day (July 20th) I called again and talked to another representative name Angela. She checked the status and let me know that it shows on her end that my phone is scheduled to be shipped overnight and I should have tomorrow. I wasn’t holding my breath at this point.We’ll here I am now, today is July 26th and yes, still no phone. I am beyond upset and don’t know if I will ever get my phone back. I’m thinking I am going to have to get an attorney involved which will likely cost more than a new phone. I can tell you this, if this can happen to your phone, it can happen to all Samsung products. I will be switching back to an iPhone here shortly if I don’t get my phone by this Friday. I caution you to ever think about buying another product from Samsung again.",1.0

The screen is very unresponsive, I have to hit the same area anywhere from 2-4 times to get it to register. Apps crash randomly. TouchWiz is still awful.

It was much better on the s6, and the s6 was a disaster. The keyboard is awful, apps crash constantly, the back button will sometimes take you back one page, and sometimes will land you on the home screen. The sound quality is abysmal. The volume with headphones is about half what it needs to be. The battery lasts about eight hours, with normal use, in entertainment mode (which is opening a whole new can of worms, as entertainment mode should be standard. The biggest selling point of the phone is the incredible display, and you're telling me that it isn't wise to use it to it's fullest potential?) A giant failure on the part of Samsung. I believe the hyped reviews have been bought and paid for by Samsung, who has been in damage control for two years, and really needed this phone to be successful. I'm done with Samsung.

1390,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Almost everything about the phone and its spec seem great and innovative.  But I can't believe the silly idea of a curve screen is still in.  It's really a nuisance that chunks of your screen (along with your contents) are rolled off on both edges.  I still find it to be a huge distraction because the rounded edges cause reflections along those curved edges.  Also, I keep finding myself rotating the phone just to see contents at the edges. The contents on your screen shouldn't be subjected to such distortions by design. So the whole idea is really, really goofy. It might have looked cool to some 2 years ago when it first came out, but common Samsung?  Three stars off because the screen is so much of what you use the most, despite the overall spec.I still plan on buying a future Samsung phones for a family member if a flat screen version is available, but the curved edges is really holding me back.  Samsung, please consider releasing a flat screened version.Update: another star off for the location of the finger print sensor.  I am still causing the camera lens to smudge because the sensor is damn right next to it.",1.0

1410,Amazon,Samsung S8,"For those of you that are consider buying this phone, let me mention some common variation of this phone:SM-G955F: International version, Samsung Exynos Processor (supposedly use less battery, last longer) , for GSM carriersSM-G955FD: International version, Duel Sim Card, Samsung Exynos Processor (supposedly use less battery, last longer) , for GSM carriersSM-G955U: US version, Snap Dragon Processor (supposedly better graphic support for gaming), I see people said the unlocked version support both GSM and CDMA carriers, but I do not have this version and have not verify this myself.Above are for S8+, S* is similar, part number replaced 955 with 950, with smaller screen and battery power.I used SM-G955FD:for about a month now, this is the most expensive phone I purchased.  Below is my list of pro and con.Pro:Decent Camera, good with low light environment.Great Battery life, 3500 amh, last longer then any other phone I had in the past.Support wireless charging, water-proof.Less overheating.  It gets warm when playing games while charging but never gets to point where it is too hot to hold.Con:Unusual Screen ratio.  Most game app do 16:9 screen ratio, this phone is thinner so when playing games, there are black boarder on both side and make it look smaller compare to other phone with same screen size in the market.  This also make it more difficult to type, I often press wrong key by accident due to spacing.Overall, I think this is a good phone.  Best Buy is offering a lot of promotion on this phone right now so you might wish to shop around before choosing where to buy it.",5.0
1411,Amazon,Samsung S8,Beware of these that say No Warranty. Mine arrived with the plastic all wrinkled and missing the headphones. Normally I would care about not having headphones as I never use them but the screen was not responsive at all. I returned it.,1.0
1412,Amazon,Samsung S8,"A very solid 4.5 Stars This is just my review of the S8 Plus. I got mine through AT&T as my upgrade. I was trying to wait for the Note 8 but my Note 4 bricked when the power died during an update so I had to replace it with something fast.The S8 Plus is a really nice-looking phone and the camera is awesome. It's probably the best feature so far (I've had mine for about 3 weeks). I don't like that I can't replace the battery if I ever wanted to.The Bixby feature is somewhat useful but there is a bit of a learning curve to using it. I haven't been using it much but that's because I'm busy getting used to the rest of the phone.One thing that I really *don't* like about the phone is that it is slippery as an eel. I almost dropped it the first time I held it because it's so slick. The phone is very thing (a good thing, I guess), but I keep it in a protective case. One reason I immediately got a case for it was just to be able to hold and handle it better. Whenever it's out of the case, I'm scared to death do use it because I know I'll drop it.If this phone has the built-in stylus like the Note series, I would like it better than the Note 3 and 4 which I've had. The display is crystal crisp and beautiful. I got mine in the Arctic Silver and wish that I could actually see it, but I have to keep that casing on it! I know that some people wanted the smoother outer design, but I'd much rather that it were pebbled - or at least along the edges. I bet half the time the phone gets damaged will not be from carelessness but from the phone just sliding out of people's hands.So, to sum up, the PROs:- Phone is gorgeously styled and the color choices are nice. I really like the Arctic Silver which is stylish and still professional/adult looking.- Camera is *amazing*. Photos turn out awesome and the easy-flip to selfie feature is nice.- Volume control is better. You can more easily control volume for all settings (Media, Headset, Notifications, etc) than before.- Fingerprint placing isn't as bad as I expected and is a lot more responsive than on past Galaxy phones.- There are temperature sensors so I can use the apps that I couldn't with the Note 4.- Wireless Qcoil charging is possible. (With the Note 4 I had to buy a Qi  receiver to place inside the phone to work with a charger.)- Sound quality - for calls and media - is especially good. This was a surprise to me.CONS:- While the body design is beautiful, the phone is slippery and very easily dropped. It's a MUST to have a case on it to make it easier to hold.- Bixby needs to be a bit more user-friendly since it's so new to most of us.- The charging ports have changed so all the cords I had for past Galaxy phones are now worthless. Also, the new USB C type chargers don't work with my Samsung tablet. It's a little like changing the game to make customers shell out more money for accessories.- There is no built-in stylus. This is such a wonderful feature - and probably the only real standout feature - on the Notes, I'm surprised Samsung hasn't integrated it into their other models.OVERALL:If I could change 2 things, it would be the slippery-ness and that there is no built-in stylus. As a firm Note 4 fanatic, I am not that unhappy to have this phone instead.",4.0
1413,Amazon,Samsung S8,"This is a beast of a phone. Its design and screen are just fantastic.Easy to handle and very sleek. Awesome camera. Nice UI. Fully featured.It is slightly slippery though.

1414,Amazon,Samsung S8,"This is a really good phone with amazing display. I received the shipment in very good shape (and all the items which are supposed to be there are included). It was very kind of the seller to also provide an converter for the adapter. It has been only 24 hours since I'm using the phone, but still here are my feedback with the limited use:Pros:- Display is simply amazing. This is the best display I've seen in a smart phone till date.- Battery life is decent, given that it's my first day so I'm using it quite a lot, but still able to get decent enough battery life at the end of the day.- Both the facial and iris recognition works very fast, I don't know how secure they are, but for me it works fine if there is some level of security and it opens real quick.- Included earphones are decent enough (not too great).- Always on display mode is really helpful.Cons:- The good old finger print whine. How can designers be so foolish to place it at the worst possible location on the phone. Seems like they were too proud to simply copy the ideal placement from Nexus/Pixel line. I might get used to it, but right now it's a conscious effort each and every-time.- The phone is too slippery in the hand, so it'll be almost impossible to carry it without a  protective case.- Again what were they thinking when they launched Bixby. It's almost pathetic in comparison to Google Assistant. I might end up remapping the Bixby button to GA anyways.- Not a flaw of the mobile, but this particular international version doesn't have a warranty (as is rightly mentioned in the product description), so you can't register the phone on Samsung US website.",4.0

Dual-SIm is active, however, it's via call forwarding because of ATT's lack of support.  The phone comes unlocked which is great if you root your phone.

However I have been told by a Samsung rep to my face that it is likely that I will always have problems with this phone and quite possible that I do not have enough technical expertise to get the first major software update via smartswitch.  I spent the return window trying to get things to work correctly and did not get to a Samsung rep in person.  All of this is my fault.

1476,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Prior to this terrible warrantee experience I am having I liked Samsung products. I have several in my home. However, when something goes wrong and you need to send the product in for service and repair, good luck!I purchased a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge earlier in the year after being a loyal iPhone user since the 3GS. When I made the switch I was pleasantly surprised how much I liked the phone. It worked flawlessly for about six months until a firmware update they release trashed the phone. Took it to a local Samsung rep. at Best Buy and he tried for a day and a half to replace the operating system with no luck. He said that it is still under warranty so send it in and they’ll fix it. Sounded great, however.I called their customer service number and they stared a claim, she took my information down and told me it will take around eleven days to get it back, then issued me a UPS label. I sent the phone off to them and they send me an email on June 27th confirming that they received the phone and issued me a ticket number. So far so good right?Well after the first week when by I decided to check the status of my repair through the Repair Self Tracking portal they have and was surprised to see that there was nothing in their system about my repair claim. Though to myself, that’s weird.On July 13th, after thirteen business days later of not hearing anything I called them again to check the status. They said that they were done with it but I gave them a P.O. Box address and that they can only delver to a physical address. Oh, ok I get it, a mistake. However, when the person who originally took my information shouldn’t she have told me that they required a physical address? Still, not too upset. They told me that they would ship it immediately and I would have it in 1-4 business days. Great? Not so fast.Five business days later on July 20th I still had not received my phone so I called again. The Samsung rep I talked to this time said pretty much the same thing that the last rep told me and that it has not been shipped. Now I’m irritated. I told him that they had the correct address now so what’s the problem?  He put me on hold and checked with the repair shop and a Anne told him that they would overnight it today and I would receive it tomorrow. This is where it gets really shady. I asked this person to please send me an email stating our conversation and confirming that the phone was being shipped overnight. He told me that they do not have the capability to send emails. What? Samsung can’t send emails? I was pissed off so I asked to speak to his supervisor. He put me on hold for a really long time and came back to tell me that his supervisor “Graham” will not speak with me and that he doesn’t have the capability to send an email either. Now I’m furious. I’m being lied to and this is getting really shady. I’m not sure they even have my phone at this point. He put me on hold again and talked to Anne again who told him that when they sip it later today, I would receive an email stating that it shipped. I was not happy and expressed it vividly.I then went on the web trying to find another number to contact or call someone above them all with no luck. So what I found is that if these people want to screw you over, there’s no one else to get involved or help. What a predicament.Later the same day (July 20th) I called again and talked to another representative name Angela. She checked the status and let me know that it shows on her end that my phone is scheduled to be shipped overnight and I should have tomorrow. I wasn’t holding my breath at this point.We’ll here I am now, today is July 26th and yes, still no phone. I am beyond upset and don’t know if I will ever get my phone back. I’m thinking I am going to have to get an attorney involved which will likely cost more than a new phone. I can tell you this, if this can happen to your phone, it can happen to all Samsung products. I will be switching back to an iPhone here shortly if I don’t get my phone by this Friday. I caution you to ever think about buying another product from Samsung again.",1.0

1513,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Note: I am reviewing this phone based on its quality and functionality, and it's full suggested retail price of $750, and not based on price-gouging from these third-party re-sellers.A quick prologue: I had been laying low since buying two Samsung Galaxy S6 Edges in early 2015 (one gold, one white - yes, I loved it that much). I knew that it was the perfect phone for me at that time, and that based on how the cell phone evolution was going on then (early 2015), I knew the S7 Edge would be an iterative succession, and not a big leap forward. So I bought my S6 Edges with the thought in mind that I would have it for at least 2-3 years. My analysis was that Samsung at that point in time had plateaued their curved screen technology and philosophy, and would move on next to foldable screens by 2020. I gave them a couple of buffer years in case they didn't feel like introducing us to such drastic technology too early, as Samsung has a habit of forward thinking, yet holding back a year or two so they can milk the most money out of their current technologies. Fast forward to this year, and I have not been wrong - Samsung has indeed matured and plateaued its curved screen plans, but their foldable screen technology has not been up to speed, so it would be delayed for another year or two (they are still on track for 2020). With the introduction and quick adoption/popularity of HDR technology, they can afford to stay on their curved screen plan for another year or two until they lower the costs of their foldable screen technology down enough for mass production.I loved my S6 Edges, but I got bored of the gold one quickly, and sold it to buy a Rose Gold iPhone 6S last year, while keeping the white S6 Edge. I loved everything about it - mainly the beautiful curved screen design, but even more so, the awesome camera, which was the best for its time, and still holds up today as one of the very best in bright light. If you go through my reviews, 99% of the photos from 2015 on are from my S6 Edge. It is so good I have replaced my travel DSLR with it (I still use my Canon 5D Mark III for my serious projects), and all my Instagram photos are also from my S6 Edge (you can find the link to my IG on my Amazon profile).Sorry for the long intro, but it ties to my review that the camera on the S8 is even better. Do not be fooled by early hands-on articles that the rear camera is the same as the S7 Edge. It is NOT the same. It is a new camera system developed by Sony, and it is a dual-pixel system which takes two photos each time you press the shutter button, and quickly and deftly combines the two to give you an awesome final photo, which contains HDR and selective focus elements/photo modes. It excels in low light conditions, with its f1.7 aperature, and it even exceeds the S7 Edge's camera. It might not compete in fast action with the ridiculous 960 fps Sony camera in its new Xperia X phones, but for everyday use, I feel this is the best phone camera so far. It has electronic image stabilization (EIS), even up to 4K video recording, which is a first for phone cameras. The front (selfie) camera is also vastly improved, but not as good as the 13MP camera of the LG G6.This is a photography geek's review, leading in with the camera, but I know most of you are more concerned with the big beautiful screen, which it is exactly that. The resolution is 2960 x 1440 pixels, or a pixel density of 570 ppi. The technology is Samsung's very own OLED, called sAMOLED. It is the same basic technology that makes the best TV screens in LG's OLED TVs. Samsung's 2017 version is so good, it is apparently the best screen ever. You can read more technical specs from Display Mate:displaymate. com/Galaxy_S8_ShootOut_01.htm (erase the space between the dot com)How Samsung has managed to squeeze all that goodness into a phone this size is quite a technological marvel, and quite a gamble as well. Instead of the 16:9 ratio 95% of the phones out there today have, they have chosen on an 18.5:9 ratio, similar to LG G6's 18:9 ratio, but a little slimmer. So this is Samsung's way of truly trying to stand out from the crowd for this generation (year). Cinema (movie theatre) ratio is 21:9, so there truly is no video/film format that perfectly fits this screen's ratio. So there will be empty spaces around the videos and movies you watch, but the black bezels will help eliminate that disparity - note that all S8's, regardless of what color scheme, have black front bezels. Some of the apps have yet to be updated to this ratio, so some will not resize properly, or will have black bars on certain edges. But there is a resize/full screen option in the S8's settings to get around this for now until the app developers update their apps.This phone is actually more narrow than the S6/S6 Edge. The S8 measures 68.1mm wide by 8.1mm thick by 148.9mm tall, and weighs 155 grams, while the S6 Edge is 70.1 x 7 x 142.1 mm, and weighs 132 g. But as you can see it is a tick thicker, and noticeable taller and heavier. So although the S8 has a total footprint that is larger than the S6 Edge, or is actually easier and more comfortable to hold in one hand. For further comparisons, the iPhone 7 is 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1 mm (138 g), the iPhone 7 Plus is 158.2 x 77.9 x 7.3 mm (188 g), and the LG G6 is 148.9 x 71.9 x 7.9 mm (163 g). So it actually is easier to grasp in the hand than most other phones of similar size, only bested by the (much smaller) iPhone 7 (4.7-inch screen vs. 5.8-inch for the S8).The sound systems are also improved, as the speaker is louder and more clear, and the audio processing is much much better for listening to music with your earphones/headphones. However, it is still a mono speaker, not even stereo-immersive sound, and of course nowhere near as good as HTC's usual dual-speakers. Speaking of earphones, a pair of premium AKG earphones are included, which is the best factory-bundled earphones I have witnessed. It cannot compare to my Velodynes and Sennheisers, but it beats all other cheap generic bundled earphones. That reminds me, you should spend the extra $100 on the extra bundle, which in addition to the included VR headset, also includes a Samsun 256GB microSD card, and a pair of AKG Bluetooth headphones. Each sells for over $100, so you are actually saving a bunch: AKG Bluetooth Headphone Black (Y50BTBLK) Samsung EVO+ 256GB UHS-I microSDXC U3 Memory Card with Adapter (MB-MC256DA/AM).My S6 Edge worked fluidly and flawlessly in the first few month. But even with the top processor of the time, and 3GB of RAM, it slowed down as the memory neared the capacity, especially after the hundreds of photos began to pile up. The camera, once near instantaneous to turn on, now takes about a second. The S8, with its 4GB of RAM and either the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor or Samsung's own Exynos 8895 so far is doing an impeccable job. The Snapdragon 821, and even the 820, is fast enough for 2017, so having the 835 and the Exynos 8895 future-proofs it for another 2-3 years at least, since I feel with each successive processor, we are getting to the point where the hardware requirements for software is plateauing, and you would only need the latest processors for video games which keeps getting better and better and continually needs the fastest processor. I think once we reach 6GB of RAM, any processor beyond the 835/8895 should be fast enough for every day apps of the next 10 years.In totality, this is the first phone since the S6 Edge that I got really excited about, and with the rumored OLED iPhone coming out this year, 2017 should be a great year for fans of both sides to upgrade. If you don't mind the $750+ price, you can't go wrong with the Samsung Galaxy S8. It is an investment that should last a few years, or at least until those foldable screen phones come out....",5.0
1514,Amazon,Samsung S8,"I bought the S8 Dual SIM from TechnoMaster. Arrived promptly. Included were S8, USA charger, USB C cable, USB C to Standard USB adapter, USB C to Micro adapter, earphones and extra ear buds. S8 was 50% charged out of the box. Everything works like a charm and I highly recommend TechnoMaster as the vendor - especially since some got a European charger instead of a USA charger. Also bought a Seneo Fast Wireless Charger and a Spigen Tough Armor Galaxy S8 case. Fast Wireless Charger works perfectly with the S8 in the Spigen case.International Dual Sim S8's do not support Wifi Calling, which is sad. Not having removable battery is also sad - my S4 had that feature. S8 is a bit slippery to the touch so I really recommend a good case. Right now I have a 128GB micro SD card in the second SIM slot. I used the S8's Smart Switch to transfer all Samsung data (including phone contacts) from my S4 to the S8 using the provided USB cable and adapter. Had to install Smart Switch on the S4 from the Play Store. Everything worked like a charm.So far I am a happy camper.",5.0

Overall phones is very quick , clean a bit smaller than i expected but im upgrading from another dual sim Blu viva xl so clearly everything was a vast upgrade lol .

As others have stated, I too questioned if the phone was a fake or not because it did not come with the Samsung S8+ logo on the back, it just says Samsung with a printed label attached with the model number and IMEI on it.Pros- In all its a good phone.  Samsung did well and always has. The picture quality is like no other.  The screen is sleek and call and music quality is great.Cons-This phone has locked features that are displayed in Chinese. I can not remove and make it English. The phone also will not pair to any Bluetooth device. The only reason I have not sent it back was because even though I had a gorilla glass screen on the phone.  Within the first 5 hours of my using it, my umbrella hit the phone in a spot that was not protected by the gorilla glass and cracked my screen leaving a visible chip near the speaker on top. So I have a chipped screen and it does not connect to Bluetooth that I need. Because the phone is the ""Asian"" version, I also can't use Samsung pay because the United States is not one of the selected country options listed on this phone. Just not a happy girl.

1611,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Love everything about this phone. Gorgeous screen. The edge feature takes getting used to but is very useful. The new interface is just about perfect. Having waited a while to upgrade from S5 to S8+, I'm finding enough new or improved functionality to make me feel great about the cost of upgrading. This is an absolutely beautiful phone. You almost hate to cover it with a case or protector. But i got a clear case from Speck (Presidio Clear) that still shows it off very nicely, not too hard to keep free of fingerprints. Purchased both the phone and case at Verizon store. Bought film protector (glass doesn't seem to have been solved yet due to curved screen) but the model on Amazon under the following name worked like a charm for me, plus it's a 2 pack in case you mess up.Galaxy S8 Plus Screen Protector [2-Pack], iTURBOS Full Screen Coverage 3D PET HD Screen Protector Film for Samsung Galaxy S8 PlusAs for the phone itself... Wow. There are some really neat improvements to the launcher, everything feels truly improved. The calendar app feels like it comes from the future. It's fast, you can multi task, the notification window is so much more versatile (reply to texts without leaving the video you're watching... It plays behind the notification screen while you reply if you so desire).Cannot recommend highly enough. The larger screen takes a little bit of getting used to, the s5 definitely wasn't a phablet by any means, but the adjustment is worth the extra screen size and resolution.They moved the speaker and the headphone jack to the bottom of the phone. Be nicer if the speakers were on the face somehow, but this is much better than the back speaker design of S5. The natural position of your hand in a one hand hold cups the audio back at you. Having the head back on the bottom keeps the cord out of your screen. Great great great.Still get your SD card slot (be careful, it's a delicate but stubborn little thing), but I'm nowhere needing it. While i was constantly at less than 25% memory on my S5 even after using SD for pics videos and any apps that allowed. I've got an SD in there now, but haven't used it. I've loaded twice as many apps on this as on my S5 (where I'd always go web versus app if possible) and I just today cracked the 50% mark on internal storage - including every pic and video that used to be on my S5's SD. From now on, I'm planning to treat the SD as a back up for pics etc until further notice. If I'm at 50%with more apps than I'll ever actually regularly use, I'll be set for a good stretch. This all tells me that Samsung did a great job streamlining three bloat. Indeed, while there was some typical preinstall junk, I was? able to delete a surprising amount of what I didn't want.Camera seems great. Gallery is neat, it'll go through and put together little photo montages for you based on date and location. Not sure how useful it'll turn out to be, but it's a neat attempt at something new.Yeah, listen, I rarely go crazy in a product review, but if you're at all on the fence whether to upgrade or if to go with this over another phone? Buy this phone. It is beautiful, functional, and constantly surprises.",5.0
1612,Amazon,Samsung S8,"I have had this phone for 4 days now..  There are a few things I want to bring to everyone attention.Attach are some photos.Background:  I didn't get the phone from Amazon, I got it from Samsung directly.  I have used Note 4, Samsung S5, Nexus 6 and Samsung S7.  Generally I prefered bigger phone.1.)  Screen definitely is nice, colors are vivid and sharp.2.)  I didn't notice the issue on the first day.  However, I noticed with some charging issues on 3rd.  First, it would RANDOMLY - NOT/STOP charge after charing for awhile, ranging from 70% to 86% then stop, or from 26% to 36% than become SLOW / standard charge.  However, the indicator on the screen showed ""Fast Charging"".  I monitored it for a few days.  I used the app Ampere to measure it.  Sometimes I get 0 mA for 45 min.  At slow charge, I see 72 mA to 150 mA.  At the fast charge, it usually at around 1010 mA.  I remember on the first day, it went as high as 1420 mA.  I can confirm the issue. Yes, I use all genuine Samsung charger and cable.  It is a new phone, got to do that.  No, I don't have too much apps on background.  Even if I do, it should still charge, at least all the previous phones I have do.  To resolve the issue, I have to either unplug and replug it back in.  Or a restart the phone.  it is totally annoying.  I am not sure if it can be corrected by firmware update..3.)  It actually totally freezed!!  I was browsing the web, and suddenly the phone doesn't response.  The power button doesn't work, volume doesn't work, no botton works.  I have to do force reset.  Out of the 10 years I used a smart phone.  I never experienced freeze.  I can feel the lag, but not freeze.4.) I like bigger screen phones better.  In terms of size, the S8 plus just a little too narrow for big phone.  I understand that it can be operated by one hand better, but having used to Note 4 and Nexus 6 size.  I find that the S8 Plus doesn't work well, at least to me.5.)  Edge screen - It is nice, but I think it is more for marketing than actual functionality.  Without a case, I find that my fingers would touch the edge, and making it not every responsive, because I have at least 3 or 4 fingers on the screen.  the OS doesn't know how to react with more than 2 fingers..6.)  May be do to incident of the Note 7, now even as fast charge, the phone doesn't feel as hot.  It is a good improvement for safety.  It is cooler than the Nexus 4 and Note 4 when fast charging..",3.0
1613,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Recently switched from a 7 Plus to S8 Plus and I'm glad I did. IPhone feels too restrictive.

1636,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Best phone I ever bought.24 October 2017:After nearly one month of having my new Samsung Galaxy S8 SM-G950FD (MAPLE GOLD), I am very pleased.First point I would like to make is that I bought this phone through another source, not the supplier listed in this ad. About the same price and the phone came directly from Hong Kong. The phone is made in Vietnam.I upgraded from my Galaxy Avant phone which I have had for two years. Still a great phone, but I have outgrown it and need a phone that is more technologically advanced.This phone works on GSM network, NOT CDMA. Europe networks are GSM so either you buy this phone and change to a provider in the U.S. that uses GSM, or do not buy this phone.The phone’s backing has a beautiful copper-gold casing and the glass front displays photo, web browsing, and texting very well. It has a nice bright screen to view and it is easier on my eyes than with my old Avant.My phone provider is Metro PCS. I have been a customer of theirs since 2011 and I loved their service and network. They provide GSM network so the day that I got my new phone, my customer rep at my local PCS store got my phone hooked up in less than ten minutes. I had to buy a new SIM for $15.00 and he charged me a $15.00 service fee for adding this phone to my plan. No biggie, small cost. I have a unlimited data plan so I added the $10.00 a month unlimited texting and 200 call minutes to my buddy in France. The only drawback is that Metro does not have roaming in France yet, so when I am in France, I will need to buy a separate SIM for my new phone. No problem, I’ll just buy an Orange SIM card and be set.This phone is a superior to my Avant. This phone is user-friendly and its functionalities are incredible. It took me about two days to get used to its new interface. The phone turns on fast, it charges very fast, and it keeps a charge for a very long time and I can go for about two days, depending on how my use.Apps: I am uploading new apps and not cloning my Avant to this one. I want to start fresh because some apps I do not want and I do not want to clone the issues from my old phone also. Also, I am not going to use AVG or Norton this time. This phone has McAfee. Will I keep it? Yes as long as it does not bog down the OS. I have added 20 additional apps and this phone is not running any slower than when I first got it and it does not seem to have any issues.A note about my apps. I added two apps that my S8 recognized, accepted, and immediately began working that my Avant had problems using. The first one is the Rheem Econet app which is connected to my new Rheem water heater. I had difficulty getting my Galaxy Avant to recognize and connect to my wi-fi using this app and on some days, it would take me up to three hours to connect. My S8 recognized the app and my wi-fi in seconds and it works flawlessly. Also, I have security camera system on my house and I use the IP Cam Viewer app. Again, my S8 recognized the app, my wi-fi-and security passcode in seconds. The rest of the apps were easy to update as well.The camera on this phone astonishes me with its quality. I have been an avid amateur photographer since I was a kid and I do not believe in using camera phones for anything but play, but the camera on this phone is incredible. The colorization, smoothness, and lack of noise in my pictures makes it hard for me to want to get out my DSLR Nikon, lol.My phone packaged came with a universal electrical adaptor but it is not the European two-prong adapter, but the adapter with two angled slots that look like a “V”. It also came with a USB-C cord, a small USB-C adapter, and the USB-C connector adapter for transferring files from an old phone to this new phone.I have not used Bixby yet, but plan too in the future.The Google GPS map worked flawlessly and my phone reception is flawless also.I bought a rubberized phone protector with a screen saver.I am not using the fingerprint identifier for access but a four-digit pin code. Just easier for me.I will update this post later, but as of right now, it was worth every penny. I am hoping this phone will last me a good five years.",5.0

1645,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Just fantastic. This phone out performs the competition on every level. I've heard a lot of complaints about where the finger print scanner is, but these reviwers must not have actually held this device. Once you hold it in your hand your index finger goes exactly where the finger print scanner is! So just use your index instead of thumb, it is incredibly natural and I actually find it faster to use than my previous s6 with its scanner in the front.The phone is faster than fast and handles everything with ease. Most impressive is its long battery life, my previous phones used to die halfway thro the day, this thing still has 30-40% juice left at the end if a very long day.Screen is great, the software is optimized.

1646,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Received on time in excellent packing conditions.  FINALLY, I purchased a phone from Amazon that said it was ""new"" and it is!  This is the 3rd one that I had to buy to have that happen.  The other 2 sellers listed their phones as new and when they arrived the seal was broken or totally taken off all together.  The first guy actually put a new sticker that said ""do not accept if seal is broken"" over top of the original ""broken"" sticker.  The second guy just removed the sticker altogether so there wasn't a sticker at all.  I've bought a slew of Samsung phones over the years and I knew what to expect, but if you didn't know, you would probably wouldn't realize the difference.  BUT, having said that, this phone came brand new with the unbroken sticker. It is working perfectly (albeit is only 1 day old now).

1668,Amazon,Samsung S8,"8-13-17: Why 4 stars and not 5?  This phone is amazing!  The screen, the infinity screen!  The last phone that impressed me with its incredible screen to body ratio was the LG G3.  With very little bezel, the Amoled display technology is bar none the best screen of all phones out right now.  The advancement in the S8 is stunningly impressive.  Sparking my excitement with technology and advancement, Samsung is a passionate company that doesn't like to hold back and listens to consumers. I'm truly a trusting fan -- and I have to admit, as much as iPhones are innovative, my displeasure with Apple is towards it's withholding of technology to make a buck off of you and me.  Samsung doesn't seem to withhold much.  The iPhone is still a relevant phone due to its established brand, but if you were to compare toe to toe with the Samsung S8 and S8 Plus, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus just doesn't compare and would appear to be a 2 year old phone compared to the advancements of the S8 and S8 Plus.  The tech on this phone is ahead of all phones presently out in the market now.  So why my 4 stars?  Well, just like Star Wars, which I'm a big fan, the S8, unfortunately has its own Jar Jar Binks features that just is annoying and I cannot ignore.1) Bixby -- I'm hoping that Samsung has big plans up its sleeves to devote an entire hardware button to an underdeveloped assistant that arguably, no one's heard of.  It's completely useless to me.  It just doesn't make sense to me as a consumer.  The only saving grace I have is a glimpse of a hope that Samsung knows what they are doing.  But this special hardware button devoted to Bixby is wasted in my opinion on what is otherwise a killer phone.  It's a blemish that holds the phone back from being the greatest phone.2) Finger print reader button -- what the heck Samsung?!  I know the iris scanner works extremely well, but after using this phone for over a month now,  I have to say, I miss my old S7 and S7 Edge, or Note 5 and even the S6 Edge fingerprint home key.  I really do!  On my S7, S7 Edge, and Note 5, even the S6 Edge, I pressed on the home key and the phone is unlocked, the fingerprint ready was flawless.  On this S8, I could use the fingerprint scanner, but it's so oddly placed that I struggle to stretch my hand/finger long enough to reach it . I find myself sliding my index finger around the camera, infrared scanner, and fingerprint scanner aimlessly, until very often I have to flip the phone over to see where my finger is at. I know right?  It feels completely clumsy and awkward.  Or if I use the iris scanner, which credit to Samsung works extremely well, but I'm required to press the power button, swipe the screen to access the camera to scan my iris, and place the phone in front of me (3 inefficient steps to access my phone from the most advanced phone in the market?).  There's something wrong with that and a major design flaw.  In design and engineering, just because it's new tech doesn't mean it's practical, or in other words new tech still needs the right application to make it usable.  Samsung missed it here.  I assume though that Samsung is hard at work on an onscreen finger print reader which would solve this problem. But reality is this S8 completely sucks because of this.  And it's not a like a feature that I use sparingly.  It's everytime I need to access my phone!  Ugh!  So, just like Star Wars, we love it, and try to forget Jar Jar Binks.Other than these strong annoyances, the phone's other innovations and advancements forces me to overlook the flaws and try to love this phone.  Listen to what I must say now:  I got this phone on a Best Buy promo through Verizon, with $300 off, so the total I paid was $420 minus a $30 rewards coupon - which brings my total to $390 plus tax.  For that price, it's a quality and value buy.  But considering the Jar Jar Binks affect of this phone, I wouldn't have plunge the full price -- no way! Also, I chose the S8 over the S8 Plus because I felt the S8 Plus was just too big, but others will argue that the size of the S8 Plus is better.  If it weren't for the deep promo, I would've continued happily using my S7, S7 Edge and Note 5, while waiting patiently for the S9 iteration.  I am anxious to see the Note 8.  Back to the S8, the infinity display is killer at an incredibly bright and beautiful at 5.8 inches, QuadHDplus super Amoled 2960x1440 570dpi.  I'm not a professional photographer and I only care about picture quality as far as my normal eyes can see, and this phone takes amazingly clear and vibrant pictures and video.  It's easy to access and the shutter speed is fast.  I love the panoramic picture feature and the wide angle is really handy.  The power and power management on this phone is extremely impressive, easily lasting the entire work day for me -- usability is snappy, fluid, clear, beautiful -- gliding on butter the apps and touch response runs with ease and the 4GB of memory manages multitasking on my phone is flawless -- I've noticed no lags or glitches, credit to Samsung for it's touchwiz software refinements interacting with Nougat 7.  I use my phone for work and play, everyday, google maps, work and personal email, shopping, taking pictures, voice and video calls on skype, viber and line.  I also have Sideline and google voice to manage an extra lines and texting.  I watch Youtube and listen to music on my LG bluetooth and streaming in my car bluetooth.  The smartphone to me is essential to my daily.  So, bottom line, this phone is incredibly advanced and anyone who is considering a new phone should have no doubt in getting the Samsung S8.  Despite its advancements, including IP68 Dust and Water resistance, Wireless Charging and Quick Charge 3.0, expandable storage with already 64GB built in, and all of this phone's grand advancements, Jar Jar Binks still lingers with me, plaguing my overall day to day enjoyment of this amazing phone.  4 stars for you.Buying this phone at a discount made it a quality and value buy.  I look forward to on screen fingerprint readers -- while I'm still debating whether I like iris scanning or not.  For now my verdict is no, at least not for unlocking my phone.  I prefer fingerprint unlocking.  Practically speaking, fingerprint scan, works better when I'm driving, at work with clients, etc.  Iris scanning can be better applied towards unlocking sensitive information on my phone, but not to unlock my phone.",4.0
1669,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Note: I am reviewing this phone based on its quality and functionality, and it's full suggested retail price of $750, and not based on price-gouging from these third-party re-sellers.A quick prologue: I had been laying low since buying two Samsung Galaxy S6 Edges in early 2015 (one gold, one white - yes, I loved it that much). I knew that it was the perfect phone for me at that time, and that based on how the cell phone evolution was going on then (early 2015), I knew the S7 Edge would be an iterative succession, and not a big leap forward. So I bought my S6 Edges with the thought in mind that I would have it for at least 2-3 years. My analysis was that Samsung at that point in time had plateaued their curved screen technology and philosophy, and would move on next to foldable screens by 2020. I gave them a couple of buffer years in case they didn't feel like introducing us to such drastic technology too early, as Samsung has a habit of forward thinking, yet holding back a year or two so they can milk the most money out of their current technologies. Fast forward to this year, and I have not been wrong - Samsung has indeed matured and plateaued its curved screen plans, but their foldable screen technology has not been up to speed, so it would be delayed for another year or two (they are still on track for 2020). With the introduction and quick adoption/popularity of HDR technology, they can afford to stay on their curved screen plan for another year or two until they lower the costs of their foldable screen technology down enough for mass production.I loved my S6 Edges, but I got bored of the gold one quickly, and sold it to buy a Rose Gold iPhone 6S last year, while keeping the white S6 Edge. I loved everything about it - mainly the beautiful curved screen design, but even more so, the awesome camera, which was the best for its time, and still holds up today as one of the very best in bright light. If you go through my reviews, 99% of the photos from 2015 on are from my S6 Edge. It is so good I have replaced my travel DSLR with it (I still use my Canon 5D Mark III for my serious projects), and all my Instagram photos are also from my S6 Edge (you can find the link to my IG on my Amazon profile).Sorry for the long intro, but it ties to my review that the camera on the S8 is even better. Do not be fooled by early hands-on articles that the rear camera is the same as the S7 Edge. It is NOT the same. It is a new camera system developed by Sony, and it is a dual-pixel system which takes two photos each time you press the shutter button, and quickly and deftly combines the two to give you an awesome final photo, which contains HDR and selective focus elements/photo modes. It excels in low light conditions, with its f1.7 aperature, and it even exceeds the S7 Edge's camera. It might not compete in fast action with the ridiculous 960 fps Sony camera in its new Xperia X phones, but for everyday use, I feel this is the best phone camera so far. It has electronic image stabilization (EIS), even up to 4K video recording, which is a first for phone cameras. The front (selfie) camera is also vastly improved, but not as good as the 13MP camera of the LG G6.This is a photography geek's review, leading in with the camera, but I know most of you are more concerned with the big beautiful screen, which it is exactly that. The resolution is 2960 x 1440 pixels, or a pixel density of 570 ppi. The technology is Samsung's very own OLED, called sAMOLED. It is the same basic technology that makes the best TV screens in LG's OLED TVs. Samsung's 2017 version is so good, it is apparently the best screen ever. You can read more technical specs from Display Mate:displaymate. com/Galaxy_S8_ShootOut_01.htm (erase the space between the dot com)How Samsung has managed to squeeze all that goodness into a phone this size is quite a technological marvel, and quite a gamble as well. Instead of the 16:9 ratio 95% of the phones out there today have, they have chosen on an 18.5:9 ratio, similar to LG G6's 18:9 ratio, but a little slimmer. So this is Samsung's way of truly trying to stand out from the crowd for this generation (year). Cinema (movie theatre) ratio is 21:9, so there truly is no video/film format that perfectly fits this screen's ratio. So there will be empty spaces around the videos and movies you watch, but the black bezels will help eliminate that disparity - note that all S8's, regardless of what color scheme, have black front bezels. Some of the apps have yet to be updated to this ratio, so some will not resize properly, or will have black bars on certain edges. But there is a resize/full screen option in the S8's settings to get around this for now until the app developers update their apps.This phone is actually more narrow than the S6/S6 Edge. The S8 measures 68.1mm wide by 8.1mm thick by 148.9mm tall, and weighs 155 grams, while the S6 Edge is 70.1 x 7 x 142.1 mm, and weighs 132 g. But as you can see it is a tick thicker, and noticeable taller and heavier. So although the S8 has a total footprint that is larger than the S6 Edge, or is actually easier and more comfortable to hold in one hand. For further comparisons, the iPhone 7 is 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1 mm (138 g), the iPhone 7 Plus is 158.2 x 77.9 x 7.3 mm (188 g), and the LG G6 is 148.9 x 71.9 x 7.9 mm (163 g). So it actually is easier to grasp in the hand than most other phones of similar size, only bested by the (much smaller) iPhone 7 (4.7-inch screen vs. 5.8-inch for the S8).The sound systems are also improved, as the speaker is louder and more clear, and the audio processing is much much better for listening to music with your earphones/headphones. However, it is still a mono speaker, not even stereo-immersive sound, and of course nowhere near as good as HTC's usual dual-speakers. Speaking of earphones, a pair of premium AKG earphones are included, which is the best factory-bundled earphones I have witnessed. It cannot compare to my Velodynes and Sennheisers, but it beats all other cheap generic bundled earphones. That reminds me, you should spend the extra $100 on the extra bundle, which in addition to the included VR headset, also includes a Samsun 256GB microSD card, and a pair of AKG Bluetooth headphones. Each sells for over $100, so you are actually saving a bunch: AKG Bluetooth Headphone Black (Y50BTBLK) Samsung EVO+ 256GB UHS-I microSDXC U3 Memory Card with Adapter (MB-MC256DA/AM).My S6 Edge worked fluidly and flawlessly in the first few month. But even with the top processor of the time, and 3GB of RAM, it slowed down as the memory neared the capacity, especially after the hundreds of photos began to pile up. The camera, once near instantaneous to turn on, now takes about a second. The S8, with its 4GB of RAM and either the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor or Samsung's own Exynos 8895 so far is doing an impeccable job. The Snapdragon 821, and even the 820, is fast enough for 2017, so having the 835 and the Exynos 8895 future-proofs it for another 2-3 years at least, since I feel with each successive processor, we are getting to the point where the hardware requirements for software is plateauing, and you would only need the latest processors for video games which keeps getting better and better and continually needs the fastest processor. I think once we reach 6GB of RAM, any processor beyond the 835/8895 should be fast enough for every day apps of the next 10 years.In totality, this is the first phone since the S6 Edge that I got really excited about, and with the rumored OLED iPhone coming out this year, 2017 should be a great year for fans of both sides to upgrade. If you don't mind the $750+ price, you can't go wrong with the Samsung Galaxy S8. It is an investment that should last a few years, or at least until those foldable screen phones come out....",5.0
1670,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Upon owning the Galaxy S8 for a month, I feel ready to give it a review. This phone is a great choice for any Android (operating system) user. The reason this phone is a great fit for Android users is that it is physically the same size as many competitor phones, but the screen is larger. This means users get the best of both worlds; a phone small enough to fit in the pocket, and a large screen.Review CriteriaWhen reviewing a phone, I consider physical appearance, storage capacity, battery life, and how well the phone does what it is supposed to do. This device is visually appealing. If you have had a previous Galaxy, you may recall the only option for black had a distinct blue tinge to it. The S8 is a true black, and it looks much better than the old option. Samsung has brought back expandable storage, which is one of my favorite features. The phone comes with 64 GB of storage, but the option to add an SD card is important for many users who have a lot of photos and media. The battery life on this phone is great so far. Granted, I have only had the phone a month. One key to making the battery last a long time is adjusting the display settings. When the screen is set to one of the lower resolutions, it still looks crisp, and battery life is extended. The last (and most important) criterion sounds general, but I have yet to be disappointed in how this phone functions. The sound quality for phone calls is much higher quality than on any other phone I have used. In general, every other feature has worked well.Potential ImprovementsThere are, however, a couple things I would change about this Galaxy. First, I’m not sure what the purpose of the “Edge” is on these phones (referring to the curved sides). I would prefer if there was still an option for a flat display. This is simply a personal preference, and many users like the Edge. My second concern, like many other reviewers, is the location of the finger print scanner which is very near the camera. The problem with this location is that users can accidentally touch the camera lens and smudge it. The third, and last concern I have, is Bixby. Samsung devoted a button to this function, just below the volume rocker. This location is inconvenient as the button can get accidentally pressed.ConclusionAll in all, the phone has been a pleasure to use. My concerns are only nitpicky annoyances, and I would recommend this product to anybody who is in the market for a new Android device. If you decide to buy the S8, I hope you will be as satisfied with it as I am.",4.0
1671,Amazon,Samsung S8," Included with the phone (Android 7 installed) are the instructions, a type C charging cable, wall adaptor, a Type C/micro USB adaptor, a Type C USB adaptor, and a set of wired headphones with microphone.I have been using the Galaxy series since the S4 with my most recent phone being the S6 (64GB version) and although I have had my complaints about each version, I have been mostly satisfied with the Galaxy phones.  After Samsung recently has a bogo deal, I couldn’t pass up trading in my S6 for the S8’s.The S8 has definitely come a long way in terms of design from the cheap plastic backing that chipped on the S4.  The S8 is similar to the one body design S6 edge with its rounded edge screen, although slightly slimmer and longer which is a bit easier to hold onto even with a case on it than the wider S6.One of the issues I had with the S6 is non-removable battery and that has not changed here as that seems to be the trend for most phones these days but at least the S8 is water resistant as a benefit from the design.  With the exception of this bogo Samsung deal, I tend to keep a phone longer than two years, so I still don’t like the fact that I am limited to the cycle of charges on the battery.  I personally try to extend the battery life by only charging the phone when less than 10 percent instead of plugging in just at any time.One of biggest complaints I had about the S6 was the lack of an external card slot and I am happy that Samsung brought back the memory card slot (capable of a 256GB card) with the S8.  It will hard to run out of space on this phone for sure.My biggest issue in design with the S8 is not with the missing home button (which so far, I haven’t missed), has been replaced by an onscreen one but instead is with the odd location of the fingerprint sensor.  One of my favorite features from my S6 was the ability to use your fingerprint instead of a password to unlock my phone or open certain apps.  It is a great time saver to me.  Oddly though, Samsung puts the sensor on the phone right next to the camera lens.  It makes it difficult to locate and you have a tendency to smudge your camera lens with your fingers.  Add a case (such as the Otterbox I have) and the fingerprint read becomes a bit less accurate.  Maybe with current technology, Samsung just couldn’t squeeze it into another location but I do think they could have thought that out a bit better.  Maybe my irritation with this will fade with some practice but I think I prefer a front facing sensor on the next phone (hint, hint!! Samsung).Samsung does add an Iris and faceprint method of opening the phone but I really don’t find this as accurate or as practical to do as the fingerprint sensor.Since my S6 used the latest Android OS, there are really any major differences in features that the S8 has.  There are a few additions that my S6 didn’t have, such as the edge feature and some odd additions too, such as Samsung adding Bixby, which to me is just another version of Google assistant.  Bixby still seems to be in development though and doesn’t always work as intended.  It does have its uses though at least but Samsung does add several of its own apps as well that I didn’t personally find beneficial but may or may not be useful to you.  One slight change from my S6 is the method of opening the all apps section.  Instead of a small icon, you swipe up to open the apps listing.There are a couple additional OS security updates that the phone has when you initially start up the phone, which does take a couple of reboots and installs to do, at least on the Verizon network anyways.The curved phone screen looks great and has a sharp, beautiful high resolution screen.  The phone is also very quick with the apps and runs more smoothly than the older S6.  Even though the phone uses a harder Gorilla Glass, a good quality case is essential to protect the curved edges.  One downside I have found of the curved edge is that most screen protectors tend to hurt the sensitivity of the phone’s edge features.  I use a wallet case instead of an open face case with a screen protector for that very reason.Battery life is better than the S6 with a bit larger battery.  I usually go up to 2 days on a charge, depending on what I am using it for.The camera photo quality is good but only has one lens instead of two.  I am big phone picture person so that isn’t a huge thing for me though.Of course, with going to the S8 means all those micro cables you have are pretty useless since the S8 now uses the Type C standard cable.  At least Samsung provides one adaptor for the old cables, making it less painful but it would have been nice if a second one could have been provided so that you could have a charging option for the most common charging areas (home, car, office).The phone is expensive (what one isn’t these days) but if you can catch a deal like Samsung’s recent bogo one, then this is a great phone to get.Other than the glaring bad location for the fingerprint sensor, this is a sharp looking and well-designed phone.4 stars",4.0

I'd don't care so much for all of Samsung's apps, but most of them are easy to uninstall or disable. The price for such a beautiful phone seems to be that it is slippery and, being wrapped in glass, it feels fragile, also the curved display makes it harder to protect with a case.

The connectivity options are so damned good. I can live without using the Bixby button or service ( still not mature enough to make it indispensable, yet). Haven't had the need to use Nova launcher either. Battery life has been quite good. there must be about 6+ ways to unlock the phone so using the fingerprint scanner on the back is not a problem. In addtion, the location of the fingerprint scanner is overblown, it's not a problem IMO. Gaming speeds are significantly improved over the S7 Edge.

1682,Amazon,Samsung S8,"Over the last few years I've owned the original (Gigantic) Galaxy Note, a Motorola Droid, Nexus 4, LG G3, Galaxy S6 Edge+, GS7 and now the S8+. I had planned on getting the Note 7 instead of the GS7 but I think we all know how that turned out. I came really close to buying the LG V20 but what essentially helped make my decision was wireless charging. No matter how gimmicky you think it is, once you get used to it, you'll not want to give it up, I promise. I wasn't eligible for an upgrade until after the Note 8 is released, but I changed jobs and they gave me a S8+ and I jumped at it.First off, it's not perfect--and I'll go into why I withdrew that last star in a bit. It may be trivial to YOU, but for me, it was enough to not give it a perfect score. Next, lets discuss the first thing you notice: that Infinity Display. I've had several iPhone die hard fans actually look at it in utter jealousy. Its hard not to. Compared to the iPhone 7 Plus with a paltry 5.5"" screen and just 1920 X 1080 resolution vs Full HD Plus (2960 x 1440) is just one of the reasons why this phone beats the dated apple device hands down. The S8 and the S8+ are dramatically different from their predecessors with a completely new aspect ratio which makes the device taller and thinner. With a 6.2"" screen you'll be amazed that they managed to cram that amazing display in a body only slightly taller than the iPhone 7 Plus and definitely narrower and less than a millimeter thicker. The argument that eliminating headphone jack meant giving iPhone users bigger batteries and other nifty goodies is proven categorically to be just hot air since Samsung managed a 3500 mAh battery in the S8+ AND a headphone jack. No matter how old the technology is, say what you want, but it still works better than bluetooth earbuds--at least as I write this. It won't be long before bluetooth will genuinely equal the quality of corded earbuds...but that day is not today.The build is exceptional and very futuristic looking, easily leaving all other designs in the proverbial dust. I can't think of any other device with a screen that is as close to taking up the entire face of a phone as much as the GS8's. I keep hearing that a move to 4K displays are a foregone conclusion and not that anyone will take MY word for it, but I honestly believe that is entirely unnecessary. I would much rather phones keep the current resolution and concentrate more on battery life. Upping the screen resolution only puts more strain on the battery to illuminate all those extra pixels and I promise you, the screen tech is out-pacing battery ability right now. Samsung, leave it alone until you can make 4K at least as good as the battery life on current models with less. The front and back are Gorilla Glass 5 and while it is durable and scratch resistant, it is STILL vulnerable to breaking, even from short drops onto very hard surfaces, so do yourself a favor and buy a GOOD case to protect your investment. After all, its not a question of IF you're going to drop it, but when. Also, that glass on front and back make it a bit on the slippery side, so despite the all premium build, it ISN'T without some flaws built into that really nice exterior.The S8 keeps the IP68 rating of the GS7 and while the speaker can get loud, its rather tinny and won't reproduce music to the degree the iPhone 7 can. If that isn't a priority for you, then don't worry, but if its a big deal, you may consider thinking of something different. I would imagine the IP68 certification has something to do with the quality of the speaker, too. I suppose you need to make some sacrifices--though if I'm being honest, the iPhone has a slightly less rating (IP67) but yet still has great speakers, so its something to consider...but remember the GS8 has a headphone jack while the iPhone doesn't. Trade one for the other I guess.Okay, my gripes. I have two so far. On my GS7 when I hit the home key and then swiped to unlock the phone it was almost instantaneously unlocked. For some reason, once I press the power button (now on the right side of the screen) and then swipe up to unlock the screen, it doesn't work. I have to wait almost a full second before I can actually swipe. Yes, I know, First World Problems...but is it entirely unreasonable to expect a newer device to be at the very least AS fast doing this as the previous model? I don't think so. My other gripe may not be an issue for many of you at all, but I can assure you for me it truly is. One of the many advantages Android has over iOS is customizing. I like several different keyboards and while the stock Samsung keyboard is okay, it is far from what I like--in fact I don't use it at all. I prefer GBoard, Swype and Swiftkey Flow. Before, if I wanted to switch from one keyboard to another while I was texting, as long as the keyboard was visible on the screen, you just swiped down from the top and the option to switch keyboards was right there. For some reason they have left this option off of the S8. For the life of my I cannot figure out why. Again, the ability to easily customize Android has always been a huge selling point for me (and I know many of you) so now making this feature more difficult to access makes no sense and honestly, Samsung, you NEED TO FIX THIS ASAP. It pissed me off enough that I totally docked a star from my review almost entirely because of this one thing. Now, for those of you who rarely or never really change your keyboard, this won't be an issue whatsoever, but I can assure you for me it was an enormous pain in my backside.Going from the S6 to the S7 I noticed virtually no difference in the speed of either model. I was expecting to see a bump in performance when I got the S7 but nope. However, the same cannot be said of the S8. I have noticed a very noticeable bump in performance and battery improvement, even though the S8+ has a slightly smaller battery than the S7 (from 3600 to 3500 mAh). In fact I have noticed a marked battery improvement as well. This is supposedly due to the much smaller and more efficient and faster chipset used. Not sure if that's it, but it certainly was a welcome change of pace. You can squeeze a bit more juice out of your phone by changing the screen brightness and resolution without missing out on much at all. I keep mine at the setting that came stock (which is not the highest resolution out of the box, strangely enough) because I cannot tell a difference. There are also different performance settings for gaming and whatnot that can drastically reduce battery length, so keep that in mind.I tried playing with the Iris scanner and fingerprint reader. My honest belief is this: while its probably important to keep security on your device, I tend to have none. I know, I know, its not wise, but hey, sue me. The Iris scanner though DID seem to work pretty well and rather quick, too. I was impressed with its speed, though it does take a bit of practice to align your eyes with the forward camera before you can truly take advantage of that speed, but it doesn't take long. The placement of the fingerprint scanner was a HUGE debate leading up to the GS8's release. Will it be an issue? That is entirely up to you. The 8+ is a tall device and if you have small or short fingers, yes it'll probably will be. Wherever possible, I recommend you go into a store and hold one in your hand and see for yourself before making the purchase. It could make a world of difference for you. I didn't try using the face unlock feature at all. Androids in years past had it and I just never thought it was very secure (ha, like I care). Keep in mind a sufficiently close photo of you could unlock the phone, too.I've noticed on the always on display that the selection of screens seems to be smaller than the GS7. Not sure if I simply cannot find the other options or whether or not that is just true--but either way, I thought I'd mention it. The basic one that is at launch works fine for me, so no complaints there.Bixby. Honestly, I cannot figure out why they made such a stink about it when they announced the device only to launch it without 95% of its ability to do what they ""claimed"" it would. They even devoted a button exclusively to its use, which is a waste you cannot truly re-map it. Supposedly you could at its launch, but Samsung reportedly forwarded a patch that would make that useless (or so I've heard). The good news is that Google Now DOES come pre-installed and works as brilliant as always. There is a different way to access it, well, slightly different anyway. Before if you long pressed on the home button it'd launch, but now you just press the built-in screen home button and hold it instead. Still works and since I had always thought S-Voice was an embarrassment of a virtual assistant, I have very low expectations for Bixby, which Samsung insists WILL be arriving soon before the end of this year. If I'm wrong I'll be happy to admit it...but somehow I just doubt it. From what I hear though, Bixby was developed by the same people who did Siri for apple, so who knows, maybe it WILL be all Samsung claims it will be. Time will tell. In the meantime Google Now is my friend.I love how the GS8 comes with standard 64 GB of memory and also includes the ability to add more, unlike apple. Great option and I have more memory available after moving all my stuff from my old phone over than my GS7 came with, now that's nice. I have an expansion card, but I doubt I'll need it, but you never know. It's nice to have either way.The cameras are great. Where they truly shine is not only are they great front and back, but both have f1.7 aperture. So they absolutely are stellar at taking low-light photos, yes, even better than the iPhone 7 (if only slightly so). I think bumping up the front camera to 8MP was a smart move. With the popularity of selfies not slowing down, it was a wise precaution. Making it also auto focus like the unbelievably FAST back camera was utter brilliance. It may not have image stabilization like the back, but hey, better is better. The S8 is also the first mobile device certified to play HDR content, which is fancy talk for saying your viewing will be bright & crisp and virtually without equal. Now when iPhone releases their next model, I would expect it to be received as just shy of blessed from On High as the greatest this or that no matter how much of its new bells and whistles first appeared on an Android device...that doesn't mean apple is without ability to innovate (3D touch comes to mind) but I would expect the next version to have a great camera as usual and a few other bells & whistles. It remains to be seen if it'll have the in-screen thumbprint reader as it was also rumored the GS8 would have as well, but they weren't able to perfect it in time, hence the awkward placement of the thumbprint reader on back, or maybe the tech isn't capable at this point to pull it off, I don't know. Maybe the next iPhone will have it, maybe not. We'll find out one way or another soon enough. If they pull it off, good for them. I would expect then to see one on the upcoming Note 8, but nothing is certain.One more thing, the addition of the USB Type C charger was awesome. As frustrating as it is to have to buy all new cords (I have like a bazillion of the Micro USB charging cords all over) I find the new design to be a very welcome one. Let's be honest, we've all gone to plug in one to our phones only to discover that you had it upside down, right? Gosh it was frustrating. Its nice to not have to worry about whether or not its upside down. They also came out with an adapter so you can still use an older Micro USB which was very convenient as well. The continuation of wireless charging and fast charging is always very convenient. I love plugging in my phone after my coworker has started charging their iPhone, and in less time I've topped my phone off and a few have even accused me of making it up--til I proved it. Their reaction: almost always, ""Wow! That's amazing!"" I think the next iPhone will probably (finally) adapt that along with possibly wireless charging. They'd be stupid not to.Is it perfect? No. But its a good improvement over the GS7, enough so that I can happily endorse it to anyone who is looking to impress their die hard apple fanboy friends, or simply to just have a great device all the way around.***UPDATE***I discovered, quite by accident, how to change keyboards--my biggest complaint about the phone--just as simple as the old method. It isn't as obvious as it was before, and to be candid, I still don't know why they changed it so much, but it IS just as simple to change keyboards as it was before. For example, if you are in your messaging app and your current keyboard is displayed, at the bottom of the screen you'll see your usual options, recent, home and back on-screen buttons, but to the far right is an icon that kind of looks like a keyboard. It's not as obvious as I think it should be, but by touching that icon you'll get a drop-down menu to change your keyboard. Again, its quick, simple if not obvious. It works and works well, I just wish Samsung had made that feature a bit more easier to figure out. With that feature now available, I bump my rating to a full 4.5 stars. My apologies for not noticing it earlier.",4.0

2,Amazon,iPhone 8,"I purchased an iPhone 8 64 GB from Ting after using an iPhone 5C for two years. I’m finding it super-fast and enjoyable to use. The screen is bright when it needs to be and dims well in the dark. It’s beautifully manufactured and Has a great camera that’s enhanced by really solid image processing built into iOS. Without doubt, the phone more expensive than it reasonably should be, but keep in mind that when you buy a high-end phone like this, you’re paying for more than the phone itself. You’re paying your part of the cost of running a global enterprise that vets the software available in the App Store for safety, provides a global secure text and voice messaging infrastructure, and invests constantly in developing the phone you’ll buy two to four years from today. Android phones are an awesome alternative, especially the mid-level phones that provide incredible hardware and software flexibility, often for as little as $250. But they’re not as joyful to use or as tightly tied to the Apple ecosystem. It’s a tough choice to make, but the good news is, it’s hard to go wrong.

24,Amazon,iPhone 8,"Compared to my Google pixel 2, the iPhone 8 is garage.-Pixel's AMOLED screen is far more vibrant and produces significantly more colors the the dates iphone's LCD screen.-Google Assistant is far more accurate, faster, and more helpful than Siri.-camera on the Pixel decimates the iphone's camera in low light and day light shots.  Video recording is extremely stabilized and sharp.  Not only is the Pixel camera ranked #1 camera on any phone camera, it is even better on Android 8.1 developer's preview, further widening the gap as the best camera phone.-Android Oreo 8.0 is far more stable and mature over Apple's latest update which looks dated and stale.Overall, I sold my iPhone 8 and kept the pixel 2.  iPhone continues to be 2-3 years behind Android in both hardware and software.",1.0
25,Amazon,iPhone 8,"Apple the brand name itself reassures u that the product will be worthy of every penny u spend...

The performance apple pack is every time 5 years ahead of its competitors . I being an Android user , ? is without doubt unhappy. I find apple the best over any of its leading competitors . They may boast of more gbs, MPs , but u can just simply say it's not an APPLE. It's always best to have a horse which is healthy than to have many 3 limbed donkeys. Yes u heard it right ... Healthy as a horse that's made for apple. Even a 4s can do better than many of the android phones....???........ If u have the bucks go for apple. Nothing else....

36,Amazon,iPhone 8,"I'll say that this phone is like flying premium economy. Your seat is a little nicer, and you might get a drink or something. But you're still stuck in an airplane seat for a few hours and you spent quite a bit more money. For some of you, it's money well spent. But many of you won't think so.The hardware is really nice. It feels really good in your hand and it's a great size. The fingerprint sensor and the 3d touch feel very natural and comfortable. It does have a great camera that does low light well. The screen is very good, especially with the true tone feature that adapts to the lighting of your enviornment. However, I don't feel that all of the niceness adds up to the pricetag.There's no expandable storage. It requires a dongle to use headphones/line out. Call quality is only okay. Battery life is comparable to midrange android devices. The A11 processor is overkill and you pay a premium for it.  It comes with some earbuds that can only be used with the iPhone and are of okay quality. You can't charge the phone and use any other accessory without buying more dongles or aftermarket chargers. It comes with a wimpy 1A charger, which would be fine if phones that cost half as much didn't come with 3.2A chargers that can charge a huge battery in 20 minutes.I often subscribe to the idea that ""you get what you pay for"", but in this case, I really don't think you do. I think $700 demands more.",3.0

50,Amazon,iPhone 8,"I just traded in my iPhone 7 Plus for a new iPhone 8 Plus and I love it. The new glass case is beautiful. I also like the display as it is crisper and the color is perfect on the screen. I purchased a gold phone for my wife and a silver phone for myself.This phone is fast. Don’t believe other comments you might see because I officially rate and run speed tests on my phones.  The gold phone, we purchased, is rated the fastest phone smart phone in the world at this time. It’s Antutu rating is 219575 and the second silver phone is rated at 216318.  This phone just blows away my iPhone 7 Plus with speed and downloading apps and animation quality. My old iPhone 7 Plus was rated at 178438. This speed is due to the new A11 Bionic chip with 64 bit architecture.This phone has the new bluetooth 5 which succeeds bluetooth 4.2. Bluetooth 5 is backward compatible to the previous versions. The new bluetooth has twice the speed of the 4.2 version and about 4 times the range. That is amazing since it uses less power and its message capacity is 255 bytes versus 31 bytes which makes the data payload of the 4.2 version rated at 20 bytes max. This is a major distance and data transmission increase in performance. I notice it when I lay down my phone and walk away and my Apple Watch 3 is still connected when before I would lose connection with my older iPhone.The phone is designed to be IP67 for splash, water and dust resistant. The camera is still 12 MP but it has excellent performance with optical zoom and digital zoom up to 10 times. It also still has the portrait camera mode with the blurred background Bokeh effect by using both of the rear cameras. It even uses the new portrait lighting mode to make your photos look more professional.In the video recording mode I really like the 4K video recording with 30 or 60 fps.  Of course you still have the front facing camera with 7MP quality for face time or selfie photography. The slow motion mode is nice when shooting sports events or shooting wildlife videos.The phone is slightly larger but is still fits into most of your iPhone 7 Plus cases. The new iPhone 8 Plus weighs just a bit more at 7.12 ounces versus 6.63 ounces.  The battery life is the same in the specs but for me it seems to be a bit longer at 22.4 hours. The rating is 21 hours.The new phone is only available in 64 GIG or 256 GIG storage capacity.Overall this is a great phone. I am happy with our new phones and it is a good upgrade in power and performance.",5.0
51,Amazon,iPhone 8,"I love this phone! I upgraded from an iPhone 7. I would have to say this is one of the best iPhones I have ever had, and I upgrade every year. The camera is bomb.com. The portrait mode is pretty cool, and even the front facing camera seems to be more clear, (less grainy). The screen is brighter, the true tone display really makes a difference on the screen. This phone is way faster than my 7. The speakers are louder also. This phone has a lot of the same specs as the upcoming iPhone x, but still feels like an iPhone. I was going to get the x, but decided that I would wait until the next generation of that phone.  If you can get most of the same specs as iPhone x for less, combined with the familiarity and reliability of the iPhone we are used to, why not do that?",4.0
52,Amazon,iPhone 8,"Worth the upgrade from my 6Plus, but what were they thinking by taking away the headphone jack? You can't charge the phone and use your headphones at the same time, unless you use a wireless charging pad, which you can't use if you use those magnetic car phone holders (if you cover the spot).  The camera is better than my 6Plus, so is the battery. Love the extra Ram and processing power. Just don't understand the lunacy of getting rid of the headphone jack.I'm also not a fan of iOS11. The update added extra wording that eats into Messages, and other screen areas. You can't click on an address and have it map it like it did in the 6 and 6S.You can't have your phone plugged in the car to charge and use for directions and use headphones. You get to have everyone hear all the map updates or Waze announcements.There is no way I'd upgrade from 7 to an 8 unless you just wanted the extra GB of RAM and faster processor.Buyer beware....",2.0
53,Amazon,iPhone 8,Much faster than my 6Plus however the lack of a built in 3.5mm cable is very annoying. If you misplace your adapter like I did you may end up stuck on a 15 hour plane ride with no tunes or videos!!! It's disappointing that they have moved all of their phones but the cheapest model to no 3.5. I'm a long time Apple fan boy but may have to switch when this one dies as I NEED the 3.5 jack!!!!!!!!!!! BTW I tried several of the Bluetooth headphones to include the AirPods and they all are horrible in my opinion and is just another item I have to charge. My wired earbuds/headphones always work as long as the phone has power.,2.0

I’ve never owned anything this nice in my life like the iPhone 8 Plus. You can play for days on end with the camera and have the same photo technology as professionals.

56,Amazon,iPhone 8,"I ""upgraded"" from an LG G5 Android phone to an iPhone 8 Plus running iOS 11.0.3. Some things were better and some were not.While my family has had many Android and iOS devices, the iOS devices cost more but generally get (much) more use, plus they hold their value better. My favorite Android device (which has gotten a lot of use) has been my phone (an LG G2, then G4, then G5).UPDATE: I ended up returning the iPhone 8 Plus and getting a Pixel 2. There was just too much missing from iOS and the iPhone that Android had plus I was disappointed with the camera. I think the iPhone 8 is a decent phone but it's not for me (even though I use iPads). Read below for more.TIP: Don't buy mobile phones from Best Buy as they charge restocking fees.Hardware comparisons: * The G5 was much cheaper than the iPhone. * The G5 has a user replaceable battery and microSD slot. * The G5 is not waterproof but the iPhone is. * The G5 has dual cameras and one is a wide angle lens... I will miss the wide angle lens. * The G5 has fast charging and includes the needed cable and power adapter to do so. The iPhone 8 supposedly also has fast charging, but it will cost you $$$ to buy the needed cable and power adapter. * The G5 has a small color charge/notification LED which is nice. The iPhone can use the flash for alerts (General->Accessibility->LED Flash for Alerts). * The G5 photo aspect ratio is 16:9 and the iPhone's is 4:3. I *MUCH* prefer 16:9. Disappointed. * My G5 developed a focusing problem with the main camera where photos would often be blurry, which is what prompted me to start researching new phones. * The iPhone 8 Plus also has dual cameras, but no wide-angle camera... however, you get a 2X optical zoom camera and portrait mode photos which I am looking forward to. * The iPhone 8 has (slow) wireless charging but the G5 does not. * The iPhone 8 has 3D Touch but the G5 does not. * The iPhone feels like high end hardware, has a great IPS screen, and has great build quality but it's a little on the heavy side. The G5 is good too but doesn't seem quite up to the iPhone. * The glass back worries me but Consumer Reports says it is a rugged phone and survived their ""tough 100 drops in the tumbler with just some minor scratches"".iOS/iPhone negatives: * Speech recognition is not as advanced but it's not terrible either. * Speech recognition does not give you options to choose from a list of phrases of what you might have said. * I found it virtually impossible to place the cursor in the middle of a word when editing text. Very annoying. * Sometimes when I tap something it doesn't respond and I have to tap it again. This seems to happen mostly on small buttons. I didn't have this issue on the G5. * No always on display feature to show time and notifications. Many Android phones have had this for awhile, including the G5. Hopefully Apple will add this in an update as it's a very useful and convenient feature. * Can't configure bottom row of touch buttons. On Android, I had a button to quickly show and hide notifications. I found it better and faster than having to swipe down. * It seems Apple does not allow custom keyboards to access voice dictation... which means you have to switch keyboards to the standard one in order to access voice dictation. I use voice dictation a lot on my Android. * Home screen is not as configurable. Cannot control icon layout as much. * Some of my favorite apps (frequently used) are not available on iOS, like NOAA Weather and ColorNote. * You can turn on 'Reduce Motion' to limit animations that slow things down, but there are still some fades and other effects that you can't turn off. Android lets you turn off all (or almost all) ""eye candy"" animations for a faster phone. * Sharing photos to Google Drive made me always select the same folder (it didn't remember the selected folder).iOS/iPhone positives: * Frequent iOS updates. This is a big deal compared to most Android phones. * Easier to communicate with other people who also have iPhones (and there are a lot of them). * Can say ""Hey Siri"" to access Siri even when phone is laying down idle and without touching it. * Better security (so I've read). * Good integration across iPhones and iPads. * I like the way that news is integrated.So I returned the iPhone and bought a Pixel 2 because I like Android better when it comes to phones (although for tablets I use iPads).I really like the Pixel 2 but the LG G5 was great too although it did have some significant disadvantages (like updates).Pixel 2 notes: * It was very easy to connect my LG G5 to the Pixel 2 using the included cable to transfer data from my old phone to the new phone. There's also an included adapter in case you need it. Unfortunately I was disappointed that my alarms did not transfer and I had to re-enter them manually. I also had to re-arrange the icons the way I wanted. * The Pixel 2 screen and phone itself are a little smaller than my G5. I'd like a little larger screen like the G5 has but then the phone would be larger and weigh more so it's a trade-off. * No bloatware or crapware (especially the type you can't uninstall)!!! YEAH! And guaranteed 3 years of updates! These are BIG advantages of having Google phones. * So far the camera is impressing me. It's definitely better than the iPhone 8 Plus camera. I will still miss the wide angle camera on the G5 and the native 16:9 aspect ratio but portrait mode and the overall photo quality makes it much easier to forget. UPDATE: I noticed a quirk in portrait mode processing that didn't apply the blur properly around someone's hair... hopefully that will be improved/fixed. * Can turn off animations - I like to do this to make the phone feel even faster: https://lifehacker.com/disable-animations-on-android-to-improve-performance-1583554900 * The phone seems very fast, even when it was installing a bunch of apps in the background. It's the fastest and smoothest phone I've ever used. * The sound form the front-firing stereo speakers is best I've heard from a mobile phone. * I wasn't too happy there was no headphone jack, but I was pleasantly surprised that the headphone adapter seemed to be less intrusive than I anticipated and I am pretty certain that the sound quality through the adapter (which has a DAC in it) sounds better than my LG G5. I'll probably pick up an extra adapter or 2 (they are only $9 each) but are out of stock right now in the Google Store. Good audio video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pi_SykMCsI * The always on display looks great with OLED, and this is a really nice feature that you don't get on iPhone. * I like that you can change icon shapes (square, circle, ""squircle"", etc.). * I found out my mobile data wasn't working. After a few hours researching and messing with stuff, I ended up having to use a new Tracfone SIM and getting my service transferred to the new SIM. * The Pixel 2 has a 'Now Playing' feature that listens to any music that's playing nearby and tells you the name and artist (even on the always-on display), but I'm not sure how practical it is. By the way, it works without mobile data and WiFi and without sending audio to Google. UPDATE: I went to Target and my phone was identifying the background music Target was playing. Pretty cool, especially if you've ever wondered what a song is that was playing. * Fast charging is great (especially when you need it), and the Pixel 2 includes a beefy fast charger. * I really like that Google increased the warranty to 2 years. With the extra 24 months I get with my credit card, that gives me a 4 year warranty. Too bad it doesn't cover accidental damage though. * The Google Assistant is tops when it comes to brains (smarts), and can be activated with a squeeze or by saying 'hey Google' or 'OK Google'.Pixel 2 Android disappointments (could be rectified with Android updates): * No battery life indicator on the 'always on' display (my G5 had this and it was useful). * My LG lets you customize the navigation bar but the Pixel 2 doesn't without a little ""hacking"" it seems. I really liked that I could add an extra button to pull down the notifications. Maybe they will add this in Oreo 8.1. * There is a double-tap feature to check your phone but unfortunately you can't double tap it to turn the screen back off (my G5 had this too)... this one is kind of nitpicky though.",4.0
57,Amazon,iPhone 8,"Purchased this directly from Apple store.  Upgraded from iPhone 5s 64gb.  If you're Apple person, almost no learning curb.  Price though is stratospheric though cheaper than iPhone X.Unit is blazing fast compared to my old iPhone.  Screen is not OLED but still look wonderful with True Tone feature.  Lost use of some software because developers did not upgrade their software from 32-bit to 64-bit.  Speaker sound is much improved and really it is pleasure to listen while watching movie.  Even though optical zoom is only 2x, it is nice to have.  Digital zoom will go up to 10x but you pay in term of graininess.Guts are virtually same as iPhone X.  Probably the last of ""old-style"" iPhone and most perfect in term of integration of software and hardware.Will do wireless charging but you'll have to pony up xtra money for charger and stand.  Unfortunately, it will not fast charge like some Samsung android smart phone.Best to invest in good case and screen protector as unit has glass back (to facilitate wireless charging).",4.0

2,Amazon,iPhone 8,"I purchased an iPhone 8 64 GB from Ting after using an iPhone 5C for two years. I’m finding it super-fast and enjoyable to use. The screen is bright when it needs to be and dims well in the dark. It’s beautifully manufactured and Has a great camera that’s enhanced by really solid image processing built into iOS. Without doubt, the phone more expensive than it reasonably should be, but keep in mind that when you buy a high-end phone like this, you’re paying for more than the phone itself. You’re paying your part of the cost of running a global enterprise that vets the software available in the App Store for safety, provides a global secure text and voice messaging infrastructure, and invests constantly in developing the phone you’ll buy two to four years from today. Android phones are an awesome alternative, especially the mid-level phones that provide incredible hardware and software flexibility, often for as little as $250. But they’re not as joyful to use or as tightly tied to the Apple ecosystem. It’s a tough choice to make, but the good news is, it’s hard to go wrong. As someone who uses my phone all day long for a hundred different things, buying this phone was an easy call. If you just want a great smartphone and don’t care about the whole Apple universe much, then maybe look elsewhere.",5.0

36,Amazon,iPhone 8,"I'll say that this phone is like flying premium economy. Your seat is a little nicer, and you might get a drink or something. But you're still stuck in an airplane seat for a few hours and you spent quite a bit more money. For some of you, it's money well spent. But many of you won't think so.The hardware is really nice. It feels really good in your hand and it's a great size. The fingerprint sensor and the 3d touch feel very natural and comfortable. It does have a great camera that does low light well. The screen is very good, especially with the true tone feature that adapts to the lighting of your enviornment. However, I don't feel that all of the niceness adds up to the pricetag.There's no expandable storage. It requires a dongle to use headphones/line out. Call quality is only okay. Battery life is comparable to midrange android devices. The A11 processor is overkill and you pay a premium for it.  It comes with some earbuds that can only be used with the iPhone and are of okay quality. You can't charge the phone and use any other accessory without buying more dongles or aftermarket chargers. It comes with a wimpy 1A charger, which would be fine if phones that cost half as much didn't come with 3.2A chargers that can charge a huge battery in 20 minutes.I often subscribe to the idea that ""you get what you pay for"", but in this case, I really don't think you do.

50,Amazon,iPhone 8,"I just traded in my iPhone 7 Plus for a new iPhone 8 Plus and I love it. The new glass case is beautiful. I also like the display as it is crisper and the color is perfect on the screen. I purchased a gold phone for my wife and a silver phone for myself.This phone is fast. Don’t believe other comments you might see because I officially rate and run speed tests on my phones.  The gold phone, we purchased, is rated the fastest phone smart phone in the world at this time. It’s Antutu rating is 219575 and the second silver phone is rated at 216318.  This phone just blows away my iPhone 7 Plus with speed and downloading apps and animation quality. My old iPhone 7 Plus was rated at 178438. This speed is due to the new A11 Bionic chip with 64 bit architecture.This phone has the new bluetooth 5 which succeeds bluetooth 4.2. Bluetooth 5 is backward compatible to the previous versions. The new bluetooth has twice the speed of the 4.2 version and about 4 times the range. That is amazing since it uses less power and its message capacity is 255 bytes versus 31 bytes which makes the data payload of the 4.2 version rated at 20 bytes max. This is a major distance and data transmission increase in performance. I notice it when I lay down my phone and walk away and my Apple Watch 3 is still connected when before I would lose connection with my older iPhone.The phone is designed to be IP67 for splash, water and dust resistant. The camera is still 12 MP but it has excellent performance with optical zoom and digital zoom up to 10 times. It also still has the portrait camera mode with the blurred background Bokeh effect by using both of the rear cameras. It even uses the new portrait lighting mode to make your photos look more professional.In the video recording mode I really like the 4K video recording with 30 or 60 fps.  Of course you still have the front facing camera with 7MP quality for face time or selfie photography. The slow motion mode is nice when shooting sports events or shooting wildlife videos.The phone is slightly larger but is still fits into most of your iPhone 7 Plus cases. The new iPhone 8 Plus weighs just a bit more at 7.12 ounces versus 6.63 ounces.  The battery life is the same in the specs but for me it seems to be a bit longer at 22.4 hours. The rating is 21 hours.The new phone is only available in 64 GIG or 256 GIG storage capacity.Overall this is a great phone. I am happy with our new phones and it is a good upgrade in power and performance.",5.0
51,Amazon,iPhone 8,"I love this phone! I upgraded from an iPhone 7. I would have to say this is one of the best iPhones I have ever had, and I upgrade every year. The camera is bomb.com. The portrait mode is pretty cool, and even the front facing camera seems to be more clear, (less grainy). The screen is brighter, the true tone display really makes a difference on the screen. This phone is way faster than my 7. The speakers are louder also. This phone has a lot of the same specs as the upcoming iPhone x, but still feels like an iPhone. I was going to get the x, but decided that I would wait until the next generation of that phone.  If you can get most of the same specs as iPhone x for less, combined with the familiarity and reliability of the iPhone we are used to, why not do that?",4.0
52,Amazon,iPhone 8,"Worth the upgrade from my 6Plus, but what were they thinking by taking away the headphone jack? You can't charge the phone and use your headphones at the same time, unless you use a wireless charging pad, which you can't use if you use those magnetic car phone holders (if you cover the spot).  The camera is better than my 6Plus, so is the battery. Love the extra Ram and processing power. Just don't understand the lunacy of getting rid of the headphone jack.I'm also not a fan of iOS11. The update added extra wording that eats into Messages, and other screen areas. You can't click on an address and have it map it like it did in the 6 and 6S.You can't have your phone plugged in the car to charge and use for directions and use headphones. You get to have everyone hear all the map updates or Waze announcements.There is no way I'd upgrade from 7 to an 8 unless you just wanted the extra GB of RAM and faster processor.Buyer beware....",2.0
53,Amazon,iPhone 8,Much faster than my 6Plus however the lack of a built in 3.5mm cable is very annoying.

It's disappointing that they have moved all of their phones but the cheapest model to no 3.5. I'm a long time Apple fan boy but may have to switch when this one dies as I NEED the 3.5 jack!!!!!!!!!!!

56,Amazon,iPhone 8,"I ""upgraded"" from an LG G5 Android phone to an iPhone 8 Plus running iOS 11.0.3. Some things were better and some were not.While my family has had many Android and iOS devices, the iOS devices cost more but generally get (much) more use, plus they hold their value better. My favorite Android device (which has gotten a lot of use) has been my phone (an LG G2, then G4, then G5).UPDATE: I ended up returning the iPhone 8 Plus and getting a Pixel 2. There was just too much missing from iOS and the iPhone that Android had plus I was disappointed with the camera. I think the iPhone 8 is a decent phone but it's not for me (even though I use iPads). Read below for more.TIP: Don't buy mobile phones from Best Buy as they charge restocking fees.Hardware comparisons: * The G5 was much cheaper than the iPhone. * The G5 has a user replaceable battery and microSD slot. * The G5 is not waterproof but the iPhone is. * The G5 has dual cameras and one is a wide angle lens... I will miss the wide angle lens. * The G5 has fast charging and includes the needed cable and power adapter to do so. The iPhone 8 supposedly also has fast charging, but it will cost you $$$ to buy the needed cable and power adapter. * The G5 has a small color charge/notification LED which is nice. The iPhone can use the flash for alerts (General->Accessibility->LED Flash for Alerts). * The G5 photo aspect ratio is 16:9 and the iPhone's is 4:3. I *MUCH* prefer 16:9. Disappointed. * My G5 developed a focusing problem with the main camera where photos would often be blurry, which is what prompted me to start researching new phones. * The iPhone 8 Plus also has dual cameras, but no wide-angle camera... however, you get a 2X optical zoom camera and portrait mode photos which I am looking forward to. * The iPhone 8 has (slow) wireless charging but the G5 does not. * The iPhone 8 has 3D Touch but the G5 does not. * The iPhone feels like high end hardware, has a great IPS screen, and has great build quality but it's a little on the heavy side. The G5 is good too but doesn't seem quite up to the iPhone. * The glass back worries me but Consumer Reports says it is a rugged phone and survived their ""tough 100 drops in the tumbler with just some minor scratches"".iOS/iPhone negatives: * Speech recognition is not as advanced but it's not terrible either. * Speech recognition does not give you options to choose from a list of phrases of what you might have said. * I found it virtually impossible to place the cursor in the middle of a word when editing text. Very annoying. * Sometimes when I tap something it doesn't respond and I have to tap it again. This seems to happen mostly on small buttons. I didn't have this issue on the G5. * No always on display feature to show time and notifications. Many Android phones have had this for awhile, including the G5. Hopefully Apple will add this in an update as it's a very useful and convenient feature. * Can't configure bottom row of touch buttons. On Android, I had a button to quickly show and hide notifications. I found it better and faster than having to swipe down. * It seems Apple does not allow custom keyboards to access voice dictation... which means you have to switch keyboards to the standard one in order to access voice dictation. I use voice dictation a lot on my Android. * Home screen is not as configurable. Cannot control icon layout as much. * Some of my favorite apps (frequently used) are not available on iOS, like NOAA Weather and ColorNote. * You can turn on 'Reduce Motion' to limit animations that slow things down, but there are still some fades and other effects that you can't turn off. Android lets you turn off all (or almost all) ""eye candy"" animations for a faster phone. * Sharing photos to Google Drive made me always select the same folder (it didn't remember the selected folder).iOS/iPhone positives: * Frequent iOS updates. This is a big deal compared to most Android phones. * Easier to communicate with other people who also have iPhones (and there are a lot of them). * Can say ""Hey Siri"" to access Siri even when phone is laying down idle and without touching it. * Better security (so I've read). * Good integration across iPhones and iPads. * I like the way that news is integrated.So I returned the iPhone and bought a Pixel 2 because I like Android better when it comes to phones (although for tablets I use iPads).I really like the Pixel 2 but the LG G5 was great too although it did have some significant disadvantages (like updates).Pixel 2 notes: * It was very easy to connect my LG G5 to the Pixel 2 using the included cable to transfer data from my old phone to the new phone. There's also an included adapter in case you need it. Unfortunately I was disappointed that my alarms did not transfer and I had to re-enter them manually. I also had to re-arrange the icons the way I wanted. * The Pixel 2 screen and phone itself are a little smaller than my G5. I'd like a little larger screen like the G5 has but then the phone would be larger and weigh more so it's a trade-off. * No bloatware or crapware (especially the type you can't uninstall)!!! YEAH! And guaranteed 3 years of updates! These are BIG advantages of having Google phones. * So far the camera is impressing me. It's definitely better than the iPhone 8 Plus camera. I will still miss the wide angle camera on the G5 and the native 16:9 aspect ratio but portrait mode and the overall photo quality makes it much easier to forget. UPDATE: I noticed a quirk in portrait mode processing that didn't apply the blur properly around someone's hair... hopefully that will be improved/fixed. * Can turn off animations - I like to do this to make the phone feel even faster: https://lifehacker.com/disable-animations-on-android-to-improve-performance-1583554900 * The phone seems very fast, even when it was installing a bunch of apps in the background. It's the fastest and smoothest phone I've ever used. * The sound form the front-firing stereo speakers is best I've heard from a mobile phone. * I wasn't too happy there was no headphone jack, but I was pleasantly surprised that the headphone adapter seemed to be less intrusive than I anticipated and I am pretty certain that the sound quality through the adapter (which has a DAC in it) sounds better than my LG G5. I'll probably pick up an extra adapter or 2 (they are only $9 each) but are out of stock right now in the Google Store. Good audio video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pi_SykMCsI * The always on display looks great with OLED, and this is a really nice feature that you don't get on iPhone. * I like that you can change icon shapes (square, circle, ""squircle"", etc.). * I found out my mobile data wasn't working. After a few hours researching and messing with stuff, I ended up having to use a new Tracfone SIM and getting my service transferred to the new SIM. * The Pixel 2 has a 'Now Playing' feature that listens to any music that's playing nearby and tells you the name and artist (even on the always-on display), but I'm not sure how practical it is. By the way, it works without mobile data and WiFi and without sending audio to Google. UPDATE: I went to Target and my phone was identifying the background music Target was playing. Pretty cool, especially if you've ever wondered what a song is that was playing. * Fast charging is great (especially when you need it), and the Pixel 2 includes a beefy fast charger. * I really like that Google increased the warranty to 2 years. With the extra 24 months I get with my credit card, that gives me a 4 year warranty. Too bad it doesn't cover accidental damage though. * The Google Assistant is tops when it comes to brains (smarts), and can be activated with a squeeze or by saying 'hey Google' or 'OK Google'.Pixel 2 Android disappointments (could be rectified with Android updates): * No battery life indicator on the 'always on' display (my G5 had this and it was useful). * My LG lets you customize the navigation bar but the Pixel 2 doesn't without a little ""hacking"" it seems. I really liked that I could add an extra button to pull down the notifications. Maybe they will add this in Oreo 8.1. * There is a double-tap feature to check your phone but unfortunately you can't double tap it to turn the screen back off (my G5 had this too)... this one is kind of nitpicky though.",4.0
57,Amazon,iPhone 8,"Purchased this directly from Apple store.  Upgraded from iPhone 5s 64gb.  If you're Apple person, almost no learning curb.  Price though is stratospheric though cheaper than iPhone X.Unit is blazing fast compared to my old iPhone.  Screen is not OLED but still look wonderful with True Tone feature.  Lost use of some software because developers did not upgrade their software from 32-bit to 64-bit.  Speaker sound is much improved and really it is pleasure to listen while watching movie.  Even though optical zoom is only 2x, it is nice to have.  Digital zoom will go up to 10x but you pay in term of graininess.Guts are virtually same as iPhone X.  Probably the last of ""old-style"" iPhone and most perfect in term of integration of software and hardware.Will do wireless charging but you'll have to pony up xtra money for charger and stand.  Unfortunately, it will not fast charge like some Samsung android smart phone.Best to invest in good case and screen protector as unit has glass back (to facilitate wireless charging).",4.0

64,Amazon,iPhone 8,"I ""upgraded"" from an LG G5 Android phone to an iPhone 8 Plus running iOS 11.0.3. Some things were better and some were not.While my family has had many Android and iOS devices, the iOS devices cost more but generally get (much) more use, plus they hold their value better. My favorite Android device (which has gotten a lot of use) has been my phone (an LG G2, then G4, then G5).UPDATE: I ended up returning the iPhone 8 Plus and getting a Pixel 2. There was just too much missing from iOS and the iPhone that Android had plus I was disappointed with the camera. I think the iPhone 8 is a decent phone but it's not for me (even though I use iPads). Read below for more.TIP: Don't buy mobile phones from Best Buy as they charge restocking fees.Hardware comparisons: * The G5 was much cheaper than the iPhone. * The G5 has a user replaceable battery and microSD slot. * The G5 is not waterproof but the iPhone is. * The G5 has dual cameras and one is a wide angle lens... I will miss the wide angle lens. * The G5 has fast charging and includes the needed cable and power adapter to do so. The iPhone 8 supposedly also has fast charging, but it will cost you $$$ to buy the needed cable and power adapter. * The G5 has a small color charge/notification LED which is nice. The iPhone can use the flash for alerts (General->Accessibility->LED Flash for Alerts). * The G5 photo aspect ratio is 16:9 and the iPhone's is 4:3. I *MUCH* prefer 16:9. Disappointed. * My G5 developed a focusing problem with the main camera where photos would often be blurry, which is what prompted me to start researching new phones. * The iPhone 8 Plus also has dual cameras, but no wide-angle camera... however, you get a 2X optical zoom camera and portrait mode photos which I am looking forward to. * The iPhone 8 has (slow) wireless charging but the G5 does not. * The iPhone 8 has 3D Touch but the G5 does not. * The iPhone feels like high end hardware, has a great IPS screen, and has great build quality but it's a little on the heavy side. The G5 is good too but doesn't seem quite up to the iPhone. * The glass back worries me but Consumer Reports says it is a rugged phone and survived their ""tough 100 drops in the tumbler with just some minor scratches"".iOS/iPhone negatives: * Speech recognition is not as advanced but it's not terrible either. * Speech recognition does not give you options to choose from a list of phrases of what you might have said. * I found it virtually impossible to place the cursor in the middle of a word when editing text. Very annoying. * Sometimes when I tap something it doesn't respond and I have to tap it again. This seems to happen mostly on small buttons. I didn't have this issue on the G5. * No always on display feature to show time and notifications. Many Android phones have had this for awhile, including the G5. Hopefully Apple will add this in an update as it's a very useful and convenient feature. * Can't configure bottom row of touch buttons. On Android, I had a button to quickly show and hide notifications. I found it better and faster than having to swipe down. * It seems Apple does not allow custom keyboards to access voice dictation... which means you have to switch keyboards to the standard one in order to access voice dictation. I use voice dictation a lot on my Android. * Home screen is not as configurable. Cannot control icon layout as much. * Some of my favorite apps (frequently used) are not available on iOS, like NOAA Weather and ColorNote. * You can turn on 'Reduce Motion' to limit animations that slow things down, but there are still some fades and other effects that you can't turn off. Android lets you turn off all (or almost all) ""eye candy"" animations for a faster phone. * Sharing photos to Google Drive made me always select the same folder (it didn't remember the selected folder).iOS/iPhone positives: * Frequent iOS updates. This is a big deal compared to most Android phones. * Easier to communicate with other people who also have iPhones (and there are a lot of them). * Can say ""Hey Siri"" to access Siri even when phone is laying down idle and without touching it. * Better security (so I've read). * Good integration across iPhones and iPads. * I like the way that news is integrated.So I returned the iPhone and bought a Pixel 2 because I like Android better when it comes to phones (although for tablets I use iPads).I really like the Pixel 2 but the LG G5 was great too although it did have some significant disadvantages (like updates).Pixel 2 notes: * It was very easy to connect my LG G5 to the Pixel 2 using the included cable to transfer data from my old phone to the new phone. There's also an included adapter in case you need it. Unfortunately I was disappointed that my alarms did not transfer and I had to re-enter them manually. I also had to re-arrange the icons the way I wanted. * The Pixel 2 screen and phone itself are a little smaller than my G5. I'd like a little larger screen like the G5 has but then the phone would be larger and weigh more so it's a trade-off. * No bloatware or crapware (especially the type you can't uninstall)!!! YEAH! And guaranteed 3 years of updates! These are BIG advantages of having Google phones. * So far the camera is impressing me. It's definitely better than the iPhone 8 Plus camera. I will still miss the wide angle camera on the G5 and the native 16:9 aspect ratio but portrait mode and the overall photo quality makes it much easier to forget. UPDATE: I noticed a quirk in portrait mode processing that didn't apply the blur properly around someone's hair... hopefully that will be improved/fixed. * Can turn off animations - I like to do this to make the phone feel even faster: https://lifehacker.com/disable-animations-on-android-to-improve-performance-1583554900 * The phone seems very fast, even when it was installing a bunch of apps in the background. It's the fastest and smoothest phone I've ever used. * The sound form the front-firing stereo speakers is best I've heard from a mobile phone. * I wasn't too happy there was no headphone jack, but I was pleasantly surprised that the headphone adapter seemed to be less intrusive than I anticipated and I am pretty certain that the sound quality through the adapter (which has a DAC in it) sounds better than my LG G5. I'll probably pick up an extra adapter or 2 (they are only $9 each) but are out of stock right now in the Google Store. Good audio video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pi_SykMCsI * The always on display looks great with OLED, and this is a really nice feature that you don't get on iPhone. * I like that you can change icon shapes (square, circle, ""squircle"", etc.). * I found out my mobile data wasn't working. After a few hours researching and messing with stuff, I ended up having to use a new Tracfone SIM and getting my service transferred to the new SIM. * The Pixel 2 has a 'Now Playing' feature that listens to any music that's playing nearby and tells you the name and artist (even on the always-on display), but I'm not sure how practical it is. By the way, it works without mobile data and WiFi and without sending audio to Google. UPDATE: I went to Target and my phone was identifying the background music Target was playing. Pretty cool, especially if you've ever wondered what a song is that was playing. * Fast charging is great (especially when you need it), and the Pixel 2 includes a beefy fast charger. * I really like that Google increased the warranty to 2 years. With the extra 24 months I get with my credit card, that gives me a 4 year warranty. Too bad it doesn't cover accidental damage though. * The Google Assistant is tops when it comes to brains (smarts), and can be activated with a squeeze or by saying 'hey Google' or 'OK Google'.Pixel 2 Android disappointments (could be rectified with Android updates): * No battery life indicator on the 'always on' display (my G5 had this and it was useful). * My LG lets you customize the navigation bar but the Pixel 2 doesn't without a little ""hacking"" it seems. I really liked that I could add an extra button to pull down the notifications.

1,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"I've owned four galaxy phones prior to getting the S8, and I hated all of them. Each one had some pro's but there were always a couple of deal-breaking cons. It just so happened that when my LG V20 died suddenly, the Galaxy S8 got a really big discount from Samsung so it ended up being so cheap that I couldn't pass it up. I crossed my fingers and hoped that maybe they finally got this one right. The screen is spectacular. Seriously, best screen I've ever seen on a phone. Better than the iPhone, better than the LG V series, better than the Pixel and Pixel 2. The camera, well it's hard to describe just how good it is. I'm a former professional photographer and rarely leave home without an SLR or mirror-less camera but I find myself not reaching for them as often now that I have the S8. My expensive cameras still get plenty of use, but the S8 has taken some absolutely stunning shots. It's also wicked fast, had pretty good battery life, reliable fingerprint reader and the often omitted notification LED on the front. So why not 5 stars? I've got one major gripe and that's the fact that the phone is made entirely of glass. The front glass wraps around the sides and the back is also glass. It might look good but, it is a fingerprint magnet, it's slippery and hard to hold, and I'm always terrified to drop it. I went through a half dozen cases before finding one I really like and actually trust (Spigen Neo Hybrid). If you prefer to carry your phone without a case, be warned that this thing is F-R-A-G-I-L-E.",4.0

Software wise, I'm happy with the ""always on display"" while I turn most every other Samsung feature off, including the annoyingly-named ""bixby"".

84,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,This phone is very nice it had all the features I was looking for.,5.0
85,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"Great phone. I upgraded from a Galaxy S4 mini. I tend towards smaller phones - I went with this because of the half-priced deal during Cyber Monday. I am very happy with the functionality and performance of the S8. I have big hands and can use the finger scanner fairly successfully - my girlfriend has issues from time to time with the fingerprint and one-hand using this phone because she has small hands. I think it's a bit too tall for comfort inside of a guy's pocket. Unless I position the phone accordingly, it pushes into my hip when I sit down. Aside from the size of the phone, I really enjoy it. I am not an excessive user and do not use social media (or most of the other advanced features) on it. I charge the phone every 3 days (I put the phone in medium power saving mode) - my work iPhone 6s gets the same usage and I charge this every 1.5 days. It is fast enough if I need to research something on the internet, switch apps, load the camera or navigation. All in all, awesome product. Just wish it was an inch shorter in height.",5.0

And in the few weeks I've had this S8 I'm very happy. There's no lag whatsoever, which is an important thing for me. Takes awesome pictures. And the 64 gb of space means I'll pretty much never run out of space. My only complaint is I wish th speakers were louder, they seem kind of quiet even when at 100%. But this is relatively minor to me so I will still give this phone two thumbs up. Basically if you want an awesome awesome smart phone I recommend the S8.",5.0

96,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,I don't use all the features but this phone takes great pics and videos.

The screen is good and the slim design is a plus.,4.0
97,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"I personally have the S8+, but bought this for my wife for Christmas as a replacement for her 'dropped too many time and cracked the screen Galaxy S6'.

115,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"Seems very similar to the S7. I don't like the curved edge; I'm afraid of breaking the screen. It has nice features but I think they should have made it less slippery in your hand if they're going to put that curved screen on it; phone case is a must. Too bad they don't give you an option not to have the curved screen like they did with the s7.

179,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"I like the S8 - except for 2 things. #1 I DO NOT like the fingerprint button on the back next to the camera lens. I have small hands and this feature is not convenient for me. So, I have to use a PIN to unlock. #2 I do not like the small size of the home button and the general ""thinness"" of the clock time. Without my glasses it is difficult to read. I want BOLD.",4.0
180,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"After lusting over the new curved edge phone, I decided it was time to upgrade when my older Samsung device started running out of memory and battery life. Unfortunately, it took less than 24 hours to confirm that I really didn't care for this phone. There are a number of reasons why, but they all seem to be linked to the curved edge glass. Sure, it looks interesting, but it isn't functional. First, it effectively reduces the useable area of the screen. The images do wrap, as does the keypad. But it takes a different finger pressure to press a key along the edge as it does anywhere in the middle. So you needed to press harder to hit the Q, A, Z, P, L and period keys than you do the middle keys. Which is to say, just typing a text or email, one has to use different stroke pressures to type fluently. This variation of required pressure is extended to the phone's built-in functionality. It required a hard press to awaken the phone, but a different pressure to use it once open. This seems to be due to eliminating the bottom button. I like the button, and believe it makes the virtual items of the phone far more valuable with it in place. I can go on, but the message is the same. I chose to return the S8 and get an S7, which I LOVE. I would say that I am a brand loyalist. I have confidently purchase Samsung phones and television for years. Perhaps I am old school, but I hope that Samsung comes out with a different phone in a couple of years when my S7 is getting tired. I will not upgrade to a curved glass model in the future.",3.0

183,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"Wish I would have paid the extra $100 or so to get the 8+. While the S8 is a competent phone, I'm afraid that most of the pictures seen in FB are cut off on the sides so I don't see the full image. Also, the screen almost needs to be pushed down to work, not like my old S5 which really was a ""touch-screen"". Don't like the curved edge as it makes it hard to type a zero, etc. Will put up with this for a couple of years and then upgrade to a wider screen.",3.0

257,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"I tried switching from an iPhone to an android, and this is the device I used. I lasted a week before taking it back. There were some features that I really liked about this phone, but they weren’t enough to outweigh my frustrations. Perhaps if I had started my smart phone journey with a droid I would have loved this phone. And perhaps I was a bit jaded by the horrible screen protector I ended up with, but I have since gone back to an iPhone. Some of the things I liked were that the screen was the whole front of the device. The fact that certain apps came preloaded was actually nice. I also like the functionality of some of the phone’s features as well. However, the screen protector was a piece of junk (as stated in another review). And, I have since realized that the curved screen might not be such a good idea. Yes, it does look cool and allows for additional options. However, it is also harder to protect. Coming from a clumsy person, this is a HUGE deal breaker. I don’t want to live paranoid of dropping my phone and having the screen protector crack, or worse because the protector fell off. Also, coming from an iPhone, the functional differences between the two are bigger than I think they should be. For one, I was almost late getting up for work because my alarm didn’t go off. My iPhone allows alarms to work despite Do Not Disturb being on. Why would I guess I had to change a setting on the droid to allow that? Come on designers! Some cooperation between brands would be nice. Not all of us want to be SO product loyal because we are forced to. I also love the new (Apple) wireless charging capability. I’m a bit annoyed that the technology has been out there for years, but Apple has finally gotten on the bandwagon. There is no reason for exclusivity like that! I’m going to say that I wouldn’t recommend this product because I have gone back to an iPhone. If you are already a droid user, you may love this upgrade.",3.0
258,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"I had a Galaxy s5 so getting the s8 was a huge jump forward. It has beautiful photo quality smooth resolution. It's a very fast phone and I love the storage capacity.

When I try to copy a lot of pictures from it to my computer, the phone hangs. So, I copy a few at a time. That works perfectly fine for me.

Based on Best Buy promotions, I went with the Galaxy S8. Sound clarity is very good, good camera, has headphone jack and AKG earbuds are included with the phone. Screen is bright and clear. Battery life is very good which was important to me. Although I've always had Androids, still a bit of a learning curve to learn all of the S8's capabilities. So far, very dependable and I am pleased with my choice. Just hope that it lives longer than my LG G4 did because the price of ALL phones is ridiculous .. IMO.",5.0

453,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"I did not go into Best Buy to buy a phone.I was looking for another product that you were out of. I walk past the phone display on my way out and a gentleman named Daniel came up to me and asked me if he could help. I was curious about the new phone a galaxy S8, and is started asking him questions. I told him I was not looking for a phone and he said that’s OK I’ll help you. So I asked him several questions, he very patiently answer them for me and I happened to notice a sign that said that there was a big discount if you bought the phone from Best Buy. I told him I would think about it I left and I came back the next day. The reason why I came back was because Daniel was so nice to me . He was very patient he was very knowledgeable he was friendly he knew his product and acted like I was the most important person in the store. That is why I bought the phone. Daniel is a huge asset to your Knoxville Tennessee store and I hope you gets the recognition that he deserves for this. Now on the other hand, the phone. The phone is ok, but I do not love the phone. I should have tried the camera more when I was in the store. I was able to go to a concert exactly two weeks after I bought the phone the pictures are Horrendous! I miss my galaxy S7 so much. Unfortunately it was past the 14 day return period. So I am now stuck with the phone that I really don’t like. Fortunately I still have my S7 and I am seriously considering going back to it. Then there is the problem with the video chat I think it’s called?. I can get every single person who has video chat on their phone to work except for my son. On my end the camera does not light up at all for me to even use it for him. And on his end it shows up that I cannot receive video chat calls. Unfortunately no one can fix it no one knows why. tech-support blames my sons phone which is with AT&T. My son and I went to AT&T and their tech-support blames my phone. Not happy with this situation. Both of us can video chat with other people on our respective phones but not with each other I would be a lot happier if that problem were fixed. For the price of that Phone I thought the camera would be so great ~~ extremely disappointed in the camera. Also extremely disappointed that I can’t talk to my son face-to-face we video chat. Wish I never would’ve bought the phone",2.0

They are very happy with it,",5.0
535,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"I upgraded my S6 to this phone and am very happy. I had hoped that the battery would last longer than it does, but I love everything else about the phone.

557,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,This thing is so fragile. Even the back is made of glass and has already cracked. Keep in mind I upgraded from an S5 that I have had forever with no breakage.

558,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"REplaced my S4 with S8. Easy transition except my memos didn't transfer so had to do it manually. Spent a lot of time turning off, deleting much of the bloatware. If you don't do this then battery life is not very good.",4.0

566,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"I am not a tech savvy dude. My old smartphone was 4 years old and was taking a few minutes to turn on and I was replacing the battery every 3 months so it was time for a new phone. I was worried that my lack of knowledge and fat fingers were going to be my downfall. I was going for something cheap figuring as that I would drop the new phone into the outhouse or I would just plain lose it. I checked everywhere and then noticed Best Buy had it on sale for 1/2 price, which was about 15.00 a month for 24 months through Verizon. This was 3 days after Black Friday. The S8 is way easy to operate, the battery life is days improved from the last one and it syncs with the Bluetooth in my car immediately. At this point in time I am really happy with it. It claims to be water resistant but I also purchased a water resistance cover for it just in case.The cover makes it sound like I have a cold but I put it on speaker phone and it works great.",5.0

571,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,We love Samsung products. Bought 3 Note8 and this S8 at the same time for my son. Phones work great. This S8 is just slightly shorter than Note 8 so it was a nice size to put inside the pocket according to my son. We always trust Samsung.,5.0

574,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,this phone was for my wife.her view is that its not that much of a upgrade from the s5 she had.The s-beam is no longer a built in feature and everything needs to be set up in one way or another.I call it customizing.The camera is a huge upgrade though.it the best feature considering we have a 1yr old.,4.0

576,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,Upgraded from an iphone 4S and I absolutely love this phone. The screen and edge is amazing. Coming from Apple it took me a little bit to get used to.. but for me I am much happier with the Samsung. I prefer the Apple Store selection but overall very happy with this purchase. I had Best Buy install a screen protector and upgrade my account and they had me out very quickly. A+ service.,5.0
577,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"I purchased the Samsung Note 8 for a hefty price and I had high expectations for it that I thought it would never be able to live up to. Boy was I wrong! This phone has blown me away and all the anxiety I had paying such a high price seems laughable. This phone is the best phone in the market, in my opinion. Buy without any apprehensions, you will not be disappointed.",5.0

585,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,I always love samsung but the thing I didn't like its that they made all the phones edge they break easy it cost more to replace it or fix it then buy a new one deductible its like 250 hope they start making them square or other shapes but not edge not my thing.,1.0

588,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"I love the new look of the S8 and the battery life is way better than my S7. Functionality is comparable just in a sleeker design. Camera is better than the S7.

596,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"Obviously the screen is great, camera takes nice photos too. I also like the iris scan for security. I wear contacts, did not take them out to ""register"" my iris and regardless of whether or not I have them in, the phone quickly recognizes me and opens. It's not able to with glasses, but just take them off pre-scan. I rarely wear glasses so it's not a big deal for me. I like Bixby, it can do all kinds of things but i don't care for the button placement on the phone or for the fact that I have to hold it down the whole time while giving instructions. I wish it would start taking commands from a single press. Battery life isn't great - I have to charge every evening as soon as I get home. Overall, I like the galaxy S8. Mine is an unlocked phone, so I can use it with any carrier I want and it didn't come preloaded with a bunch of worthless apps.",4.0

599,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"Samsung has ""improved"" their Galaxy phones with the S8 and the edge to edge screen, but it is difficult to find a screen protector that will stay on at the curved edges. Also difficult to select area along the curved edges. Samsung wants to wow you with extraneous features but does not take the time to ensure that basic phone features work as expected. How much money did Samsung spend to develop the worthless Bixby to try to compete with Siri while my finger or stylus rolls off the curved edge of the screen?",3.0

601,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,I consider this phone one of the best. The design with the edge screen is awesome. There are too many great features to mention. Love the long-life battery. I usually get a day and 1/2 out of the battery. The latest Oreo OS system is coming soon also.,5.0

618,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,I haven't had the phone to long. It seems to be doing good. There is quite a few functions to the S8 that I have yet to learn how to use. Overall I think it is a good phone.,4.0
619,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"Purchasing this phone just solidifies what I knew all along. There is just way too much hype with iPhones. Samsung and Android deliver a 1-2 punch that K.O.'s all the other competition. My S8 is fast, durable, reliable and more than smart, it's downright genius.",5.0
620,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"Great phone, delivery was fine but the curved screen is a nightmare if you like to use screen protectors to safeguard your investment. None of the glass ones work well and they will crack easily on the curve if hit. PET ones fit good but don't offer the protection of tempered glass. Just beware.",4.0

631,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"My Galaxy S7 screen cracked and I decided to get the S8 since the deal was so good. My monthly payments dropped in half due to the Black Friday discount. I am a long-time Galaxy phone user. So, I will only compare this phone to my previous ones. It's slightly larger and clearer. It's extremely fast and the battery lasts all day. I have also doubled my memory from 32gb to 64gb. Moving my data took some time because the rep used her phone as the mifi and store wifi was too slow, the transfer took over an hour. Also all of my music did not make it. I went home, erased the data, and reloaded the music on my home wifi and it took less than 5 minutes. So, I recommend that you do it on your own. It's very easy to do. Overall a great phone. After having had preset buttons, this phone has taken some getting used to with the screen mode for them. Also, I prefer the Google launcher and switched to the Samsung one. My one gripe is that the phone seems a little less touch sensitive and I have to sometimes swipe down several times to get the menu shortcuts to activate features. I would rate this phone at about a 4.8 but I am rounding up to 5 stars. All that said, I would recommend this phone after using it a month.",5.0

It took about 5 hours of phone use to really start learning the new OS and now, about 2 weeks later, it feels like second nature. I love the galaxy. It is so much better than the iPhone. In recent headlines about Apple being sued for slowing down iPhones, I think now is the perfect time to switch to a company that does not do that. I do miss iMessage, FaceTime, and a good camera while using Snapchat. But besides those 3 things, there has been nothing that I miss from the iPhone. Make the switch. You won't regret it. If you do actually regret it, you do have 2 weeks to return the phone to bestbuy and only need to pay a $30 restocking fee. But I am sure you will like it.",5.0

But the speech feature still needs work. 0ne word of advice: do not establish facial recognition as a security measure. It doesn't work in dark conditions and can be a problem at other times. Instead, establish a pin. Verizon put through a software update that rendered the facial recognition unusable and effectively locked me out of my screen. It took hours on the phone to get this fixed.

714,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"I decided to upgrade to a Galaxy S8 when it went on sale Black Friday weekend because my S5 battery was going out fast. I love the phone, it has many upgrades over the S5, but I am a little disappointed with battery life. I still can't get though a day without having to put it on a charger. I do use it a lot and have many applications (I use it for work) but I expected longer battery life. Other than that, the phone is really great. Don't buy Apple, get a phone that can have expandable memory (micro SD card) it makes life a lot better. The only other complaint I have with the phone is that Samsung phones no longer have a removable battery, so no hard booting. Am hoping that this doesn't prove to be a problem. It was nice to have that feature (plus the ability to replace the battery if needed) The phone itself is a nice upgrade and feels like it is made of quality materials.",4.0

My G4+ has a cleaner Android experience. So I returned the S8 and went back to my Moto G4+ and am glad I did.

832,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,I have had many samsung phones and have always loved them. This new samsung galaxy s8 is by far the worst phone I have owned since I have been born. The curved glass makes it near impossible to type with bigger fingers. Once you put on a Lifeproof case IT IS IMPOSSIBLE to type. I know samsung doesn't care about the case options but I do because I ruin phones. They counter that by offering the ACTIVE line at a larger cost but then there is no options for a case at all and I do not trust a phone without a case. The Bixby button is the most aggravating button on the phone. They should make a way to delete it from the phone completely. The bluetooth connectivity of the phone is spotty. I have nothing but issues trying to connect to my devices where my s6 had no issues at all. I regret ever purchasing this phone and I warn others to stay away if you live an active lifestyle.,1.0

840,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"I have had my S8 for about 2 months now. I did some serious research before I upgraded from my S7. I always read the bad reviews first to see if there are any issues that are common within the reviews. From what I have read, most issues seem to be with the owners unfamiliarity with the operating system and certain conformity with other apps such as Android Auto and their particular vehicles idiosyncrasies. There also seem to be some Bluetooth issues that seem to be problematic within certain systems. Rather than work out the kinks, some feel that returning the phone is their best option. They may find the same issues with the phone they wind up with as well. Newer operating systems sometimes have problems with certain apps, but that does not mean that the hardware is to blame. I figured that out when Samsung pushed out nougat to the S7. I had all kinds of issues after that. My new S8 has been flawless as far as working with other apps and systems. I currently have a new Chevy and the most current Android Auto works seamlessly and connects quickly to the system. I have no issues picking up my internet from the modem and it's extenders while in my house. In my opinion, the phone is as good as the cell provider you work with. The phone structure itself is much better than my S7. The screen is awesome and responds well to my touch. I love the fact that I can add an SD card to expand the storage up to 256 GB. I store all of my photos and video on the SD card, freeing up my phone storage for more wonderful apps. I use the medium power setting and the battery lasts all day but needs to charge at night (quick charge takes about an hour to fully charge the phone). I have never owned a smart phone that has lasted more than a day, no matter what the manufacturer claimed and I have owned HTC, Blackberry,Motorola and Samsung. They all last a day under normal my use. I keep a external storage battery on hand if I go to an amusement park or some other events. I have read about some issues that have manifested themselves after several months of use. I cannot comment on these because I have not owned my current phone that long. As with all phones, the glass screen is breakable if dropped the wrong way. I owned my S7 for about 2 years and after repeated drops finally managed to cause a separation between the glass and some backing, hence my upgrade. I insure my phones as everyone should consider doing who spend upwards of 1K for their pocket computer. As for me, I perfectly satisfied with my S8. The face recognition works decently and the fact that the finger print pad is on the back of the phone, I have not found this to be an issue as some others have.If anything changes in my satisfaction, I will amend this comment, but until that time, this is a great smart phone.",5.0

859,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"I bought my at an ATT store, and instantly I was in love with my new phone. Almost everything can be personalized except for one really annoying little button called Bixby, which has no apps that work with it that I want to use. My solution was to mute Bixby, but wish I could have that button work the app of my choice. Probably would just disable it though. The next huge issue that I have is the flat fingerprint scanner. On my old Nexus phone it had a concave finger print scanner on the back that could read your finger print in any direction, but on the Samsung phone you have to have you finger perfectly aligned or it wont be able to read your finger, and its sucks because as my beautiful nails grow, I can no longer use the finger print scanner. My last issue is the keyboard. The Samsung keyboard really sucks bad. I should have replaced it with another on the first day, but I didn't. Now that I have, the thing is amazing. The camera on this phone is better than that on my Lecia digital camera, or should I say a lot easier to use, the Lecia has too many technical options for me. But I can take better product shots with my phone than the Lecia. My last phone only came with a little bit of internal storage, so of course I love the ample storage on the S8.

The sales girl asked me if I wanted one, but did not truly impress upon me the importance of a screen protector with the way this device is designed. I mean come on, a phone like this and the glass should be strong enough to hold up at least the first few days without incident. Should have done more research before purchasing. I went in the next day on got a $40.00 screen protector, the next week my phone fell and it popped right off. They need to make a better designed screen protector. Should have paid for the lifeproof.

955,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"I've been a loyal Samsung Galaxy fan for years. I recently purchased the new S8 and to say I am highly disappointed would be an understatement. The screens (front and back) are way too fragile for smart phone use. Both of my screens cracked in the first few days from simple (dare I say normal) accidents. The front screen cracked when I dropped the phone on my carpeted office floor from my desk - approximately 27.5"". The rear screen cracked when it literally hit the side of my bed as I knocked it off the nightstand while silencing a 0500 alarm...then fell to our Berber carpeted floor. I paid a hefty penny for a phone that is entirely too fragile and is no longer weather resistant...thanks to the cracked glass. I was quoted a ridiculous sum from a local repair shop to fix both sets of glass. I've decided to hold onto my cracked phone until the S9 comes out and hopefully is equipped with more resilient glass. Oh did I mention I had a Zagg cover on the front glass?

It is difficult to apply enough pressure to the touch screen with the protector on, however, I will not use this phone without one. The screen protector is already cracked on my phone after two weeks of normal use. Haven't dropped it at all, just broke it my pocket.

Issues I read about like the finger print scanner being difficult to use are a non issue as far as I am concerned. It is easy to access and is easy to use.I love that the phone is a little more narrow than the s7 because getting my hand around it is much easier, so one handed use is no longer frustrating. I also think the non physical home buttons aren't a problem either. I thought maybe I would have a problem with that but I didn't at all. Overall a great phone (so far).

What the worst that could happend, if i hated it, I just resume using my iphone 6 and wait for the new iphone X coming in fall. The best thing about iphone is that apple understands its consumer and offers what they want and needs, simplicity without the unnecessary steps that us iphone users are not used to. At 1st, I hated dealing with open market and having to consent, affirm and comply to everything, as well as the security allow for everything and re-directs to be able to acomplish things. So, how did I manage and learned in 1 month how to overcome all my android open market fears and simplify my galaxy life...???. I turned it into an iphone ..!!! Easy-peasy....; Just downloaded a security app for monitoring health of my device and shut down all automatics, only allowing those that i trust. The Galaxy s8 also comes with customizable icon view option to make it look and feel like an ipnone, ain't that something. And best, but not the least, shut off Annoying BIXBY..!!!.

988,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"I've been a Samsung supporter dating back to the Galaxy Note 2. In fact I still use this device around the house, connected to wifi, and have never had any issues with it. My most recent device has been a Note 4. This device was also wonderful. Yesterday I upgraded to the Galaxy S8. Even though the Samsung brand has taken a hit with the Note 7, I still believed that the Galaxy products were of high quality, I decided to remain loyal and continue with another Galaxy phone. That opinion has now changed. My 26 hour experience with the S8 is leading me to rethink my opinion of all Samsung devices. While driving home from dinner, my device slipped out of my pocket and wedged itself between the seat and plastic console. A drop of less than 6 inches caused a spiderweb crack that has reached all 4 sides of the device. It's unacceptable to me for a device to crack under such conditions. I've known Galaxy phones to be sturdy, high quality phones; and somehow the S8 does not meet the same standards previous Galaxy phones have. My first instinct is that I must have received a defective device, as all my previous experiences with Galaxy devices have been positive. Returning from dinner though, I looked into reviews of this device, and durability has been called do into question. I would hate to see that this is how the brand has changed. I'm not sure I can remain a Samsung user under these circumstances. I've resisted switching over to Apple devices for years, but given these circumstances, it may be time to switch.",1.0

S5 does. 2. Call logs: there is no call log feature for you to sort dial, missed, received, rejected calls. S5 does. 3. Samsung key: doesn't automatically pop up spelling between languages. I used 4 languages interchangeably when I text or email. S5 understands the language I'm using and pop up correct spelling. With S8, I have to move the space bar to pick the language if I want to type a word in that particular language. it takes longer for my text nowaday. Not fun. Very inconvenient and time consuming. 5. Calculator: too many keys and features that make the keys too busy. 6. Battery: short life. 5 hrs for constant talk and web surf. 7 hrs for doing nothing.

1029,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"Did quite a bit of research on the net and youTube before settling on it, bought it, spent 20+ hours setting it up, and, realized that if you take time to know it, it's simply awesome. The display is terrific, even covered with a good screen protector (I use Illumi Aquashield), I set a picture of my kids as wallpaper and it seems like it's etched on ceramic, the curved screen makes the picture a piece of art. Apps load instantly, and the SD cart allowed me to add 128GB to the standard 64GB for cheap. Some reviewers don't like the fingerprint on the rear, but a secret: with a good case like a Spigen, it is so easy to feel the opening for the lens, you just put your finger to one side of the opening and unlock your phone instantly - no risk of smudging the camera lens. I agree that without a case, it was much harder, but I would never use such an expensive phone without a case - would you? The Spigen herringbone looks great, feels great. Customizing the theme, the wallpaper, the lock screen, the ""always on"" screen are all very easy, and organizing app icons is a charm. Just longpress and either pick from the context menu or drag where you want it; dragging an icon on top of another one automatically creates a group you can name. So I now have ONE app screen with a group for each thing, e.g Communications, Office, Finance, Shopping, Travel etc... And it charges so fast with a fast charge wireless charger, and the battery lasts plenty for a full day of work (I do 5:00AM to 6:00PM) and an evening of playing with it.

1104,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"Its good, but there are some things to not like. The Bixby button is in the way and Bixby doesn't work anyway. The finger print scanner is in an awkward location and so far I find the face recognition to be less than effective. What light you are in seems to make a big difference. I also hate that I hate that I must open an email to delete it, unlike my nexus 5x on which I could just swipe an email away without opening it.",4.0

1107,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,I've only had the phone for a couple of weeks. So still getting used to the new features. Don't know for sure if I like or use the edge screen or folders.

1117,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,I haven't found anything negative about it yet. The camera takes beautiful clear pictures. It has plenty of memory. I just lover it.,5.0
1118,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"Had the Galaxy S5 and thought it was time to uograde. The S8 has a larger screen and takes good pictures but honestly I think the S5 is every bit as good and in fact I like its size better. In my personal opinion I wish I had stayed with the S5 instead of dishing out the money for a new phone. THEN, I'm having trouble finding instructions on how to use the features on the S8. There doesn't seem to be a manual for it. I admit I'm up in years and don't understand all that I should, but I don't recommend the S8 over the S5. I will say that the AT&T staff has really been courteous.",2.0
1119,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"We all know what's great about the phone by now and it is fantastic. There is only one thing I have found thus far that annoys me, the bixby button. I hit it all the time on accident and it lights up the phone even when locked. I'm hoping this will be fixed. The only button that should light up a locked phone should be there power button. I was worried about the location of the fingerprint scanner and every review seems to say the same thing, ""it's awkward to reach"". I have not found this to be true in my case. Not only has it been convenient, it's been super responsive, fast and reliable. With my s6, it was so inconvenient because it would constantly take several attempts to unlock with a fingerprint, the s8 doesn't seem to suffer from this. I have no issues with the location or accuracy. I really have nothing but praise for this phone. If not for that pesky bixby button, it would be flawless. This is only my second Samsung phone having owned cell phones since 2003 and generally updating annually, this is far and away the best I've ever owned. I'm glad I hung onto my Galaxy s6, nothing compelled me to give it up until the s8. No regrets.",5.0

1121,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,Best cell phone I ever owned.,5.0
1122,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"The curved edge makes it a little difficult to tap anything that might be on that edge. The other big issue with this phone so far, is that the Gadget Guard protective cover that AT&T sells for it will not stay on and can be broken with literally NO effort. I have had several now and can flip them off with my finger nail. They do not seat down to the phone's face, only a light adhesive around the edges. And when the cover is on, you can not tap the phone easily because it doesnt make contact with the face of the phone. Over all I would say the phone and protector are a bad design.",2.0

1155,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,the s8 is killer! upgraded from the S6,5.0
1156,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,The rounded edges make it very important that you find the right screen protector. Even with that - it lifted up with the case for a few days. Fingertip sensor on the back is the worst change. Right next to the camera and it's not a natural way to hold your hand. But face and eye recognition means I don't have to deal with that. Battery lasts much longer. Overall happy with the phone. I upgraded from the Samsung 5.,4.0

1166,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"This phone is great, I was worried about the curved screen because I've never had one before, but it is actually wonderful. The camera is great. The battery lasts for hours! I actually do not mind not having buttons at the bottom of the screen, the screen detects when you press where they would be and vibrates slightly to let you know it feels it. Not a bother at all. My only problem would be the fingerprint sensor, it only works about once every five times you try to use it. Sometimes it will not even work on certain fingers. It is slightly frustrating. Also, face recognition only recognizes me half of the time, if that. Other than the touchy biometrics, this phone is awesome and I would recommend it to anyone.",5.0

The eye scanner dosent work all the time the finger print works some times and it makes you us your pin it can't make up it's mind what it wants to do so it gives you an error code and says sorry half the time but when it works it works well so that's something I would change I don't like that the fingerprint scanner is on the back of the phone it's hard to use.",4.0

I always get Otterbox Defenders when I buy a new phone, those cases have probably saved me thousands of dollars. The 5 was enormous in the case. Even in the Otterbox, the 8 fits into my pocket easily. Much more narrow and thinner. UI works very well. Very responsive. I haven't noticed any lag.

Wow what a difference. This is one impressive phone. I had pre-ordered it and have had it several days now. Everything worked right out of the box. It is quick on all fronts...OS, connectivity, battery charging. A great display and easily customizable organization. And the battery easily lasts a full day with decent usage. So far I am very happy with it. The only complaint is that I feel I have to put a case on it. While it is a great form-factor, the back is slippery and video tests on YouTube show it to be breakable if dropped. That kind of hides the beauty and feel of the body. Oh well.",5.0
1209,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"Samsung, Google, and A.T all T. have apps going on this thing. I disabled all the automatic updates, yet something called ""launcher"" updated on its own. Still don't know what it was. After that, the phone froze up, I had 20 apps disappear and it kept restarting in a loop. I also couldn't get any of the recognition software to work. I think that was part of the issue as well, because the screen it would freeze on was my lock pattern screen/face recognition screen (which never worked!). So back it went to the store. Don't know if I'll try another one. Hope this one was just a lemon. Also, the phone has way too much stuff on it, and that's b/c of the 3 different brands competing on this phone. All the Samsung junk, the Google junk (that you need), and the loaded A.T and T bloatware. If iPhone had Swipe, I'd probably get one.",2.0

The camera front & back deliver great pictures & video as well as have countless preloaded filters for your disposal. The Edge & split screen feature adds to my convenience as I'm sure it being waterproof will but my 8 won't be going in any water. The battery balances out even with it's performance.

1227,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"Do you want a phone with the ruggedness of a Lifeproof or Otterbox Case? Do you want the battery life that can last more than 12 hours with heavy usage? Want a screen that’s beautiful but not made of the cheapest glass someone can glue onto a frame? Those and so much more? Then I think the Galaxy S8 Active is for you. The battery life of the S8 Active is nothing short of great. It has a 4000 mAh battery that even with playing games and going on youtube for hours, I still have more than 50% battery within 12 hours. If you just keep this in your pocket and use it to listen to music, respond to texts here and there along with a few calls, this battery should easily last you a day if not more. For durability, it’s true, the raw screen itself is prone to scratches, but it’s definitely shatter/crack proof. I’ve dropped this thing on metal surfaces at a gym a few times and there are both no scratches and no cracks of any sort. The phone has a pretty rubber back with a metal frame with super-sturdy construction. If tight pants and phones don’t make a good combo, it’ll probably be because the pants break first. The only thing this thing needs to be really safe from any long-term exposure to wear and tear is a dedicated anti-scratch screen protector. Although in 1 year the phone may perform perfectly, the scratches on the screen may make it look like a 3 - 4 year old phone. The Cameras are great. The Back camera can go up to 12 mega pixels with a 4:3 aspect ratio, and 9.1 mega pixels with a 9:1 aspect ratio. The front facing camera can go up to 8 mega pixels with an aspect ratio of 4:3. The displace can scale from 1480x720, 2220x1080 and 2960x1440. I use 2220x1080, and the great detail for any application, videos, game, regular use, is way more for me than needed to satisfy my detail crave. Connectivity is standard but still good on this phone. You have a SIM/micro SD card slot in a form like the apple phones, a USB C port and something Apple phones lack, a 3.5 mm audio slot. Connecting to a PC is much easier compared to my old phone. The old phone I had would connect and disconnect from PC’s when trying to transfer files which got annoying to no end. But the OS on the S8 Active (probably same as the regular S8) allows you to easily switch connectivity modes to fix anything if you can’t transfer files correctly the first time. Processing power on this thing is great. It’s got a Qualcomm® Snapdragon™ 835 with 8 CPU cores. For most modern applications at the writing of this review, there isn’t much I can throw at it that it can’t go through easily. You can play games and multi-task at the expense of some battery life, but you can definitely do it. I’ve had no real problems with this phone, just amazement and satisfaction. If you just want a phone without needing to deal with a case and can take the blow of sacrificing the regular S8’s curved corner screen, then this phone is a serious must get.",5.0
1228,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"After about 6 months my wife's phone, which was also a s7 active, was very glitchy to the point of almost being unusable. For example it was very slow to load anything, restarted on its own, apps that worked great stopped working, etc. I have had the S7 Active for a little over a year now and it was a great phone when I first got it. I loved this phone easily the best phone I have had, it looked great, was fast, ran like dream. But now that it is a year old its not so great anymore, mainly being its glitchy, slow, apps have issues running now, some apps barely work. What is sad to me is my old Galaxy Note 3, yes the beloved note 3, almost works better and runs more smoothly than my S7 Active now. Unfortunately I will likely have to upgrade to a new phone soon because the problems are slowly getting worse with each new update and patches.

Why would you have glass all around. The Speaker is placed at the right hand bottom corner, which is usually where I hold my phone and it gets blocked. I have to keep adjusting my hand and that make it a little difficult to hold it. The earphone is smaller, so unless you hold it correctly I cannot hear the caller at all.

Bixby feels a little forced at times and it can be difficult to escape Samsung's sales team. I have cracked my phone twice, even with an OtterBox. Bluetooth tends to be sketchy at times.

An external storage slot lets you keep more photos, videos and music. Honestly the statement above it just part of the features that this phone offers. I recently change to Samsung and I want to share my experience with all of you. Let's start with the design, the way Samsung made the S8+ it just amazing, very light weight, feels really nice on your hand and the screen design is just beautiful. Features: The camera is just a mine blower the quality of the pictures are just simply amazing, if you are addictive to your social media this phone will give you the best pictures for you to post in your media, make sure you use the ""selective focus"" feature on your phone for great results, if you are in a restaurant and want to share your favorite dishes with your friend make sure you use the ""Food "" feature on your camera for best resolution. Now let's talk about Bixby, you may have said who or what is that correct? well Bixby is like Siri but in a better way, no honestly it is... Bixby got a better respond and is really fast finding the things you need on the phone and on the web, also when you use Bixby Samsung give you XP points so you can use them to claim rewards in the Samsung store, that's pretty cool. The apps: I must have said that for some reason the apps work a lot better on this phone then the others. I believe the reason is because there are no restrictions on the app features. another cool features that this phone have is that it works well with any Microsoft apps like word, excel power point and outlook, is like having a window phone combine with android. You can also open your work attachment and modify them at the palm of your hand. Bluetooth: this feature allows you to connect to 2 Bluetooth devices at the same time. last but no least: the face recognition, the finger scanner and the Samsung pass features will ensure that your personal information, payments and online bills remain highly secure. These features will give you a peace of mine even if your ever loss your phone. Well I hope this information is helpful and somehow help you to decide what's your new phone is going to be in my personal opinion I don't have any regrets, the Samsung s8+ offers the best technology out there as now. Thank you all and best of luck.",5.0
1256,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,This is by far the best phone I've ever had. Pros: The pictures it takes are amazing and are even clear at night.

1257,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"I wanted to test the phone in different conditions to have a fair assessment on how it handles different circumstances. So far I have to admit, the phone is outstanding in regards to hardware, having the 6.2 inch display in a phone that could easily be used with one hand is a work of art. The battery easily lasts a full day with heavy use. Camera access is fast and bixby is really useful if you take the time to learn to utilize it. Also being able to split screen two apps is really useful, many might not think of it as unique since Android 7.0 implemented it into most devices, but the thing that isn't emphasized on is when you do split let's say maps and Spotify on other devices maps stops updating your navigation if you accessing Spotify and vice versa, whereas on Samsung's software both apps are always updating and running. I was also on the fence between this phone and the Note 8 but the smaller size and longer battery seemed to be more useful day to day features than the S-pen and dual rear OIS cameras. These are just an overview of my experiences since having the phone, only thing that needs to be adjusted is bixby lagging a bit after launching due to the new update, but it's a minor glitch in all honesty.",5.0
1258,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"This phone has been my everything for the past 3 months and through the good (and sometimes bad) I have found that this beauty has outperformed my other devices and has left my table and other smartphone in the dust. The screen is bigger on the plus, but that's just the tip of the infinity display. The screen is super sharp, the colors pop, and most importantly having the screen on and active does not kill your battery. I found myself watching movies on this device, balancing spreadsheets, popping open one note, and actually playing games. Some of the cooler things about this iteration of the Samsung's flagship phone is the google assistant and bixby combo. Some people aren't a Bixby fan, but used in conjunction with google assistant, its pretty useful and to be honest, its pretty cool. I am able to open all native apps, schedule upcoming events, add alarms, take notes, and a plethora of other day to day tasks using Bixby and Google assistant. The unlocked S8+ allows for less bloatware, but buyer beware (here comes the bad) the unlocked phone does not support wireless calling or data while the phone is in use. These things are service provider specific and unfortunately Samsung has not been able to add these items to an unlocked device. That minor annoyance does not take away from the functionality of the phone. I still talked a plenty, played tons of games, and managed work on this gorgeous piece of equipment even with the software limitations/restrictions. The battery life on this device is outstanding, far surpassing my s7. The camera is also outstanding and the ease of connecting with other Samsung devices (think Gear S2, Gear 360) has improved.

1261,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"Samsung Galaxy S8+ Phone Review: Bigger Screen, Better Phone? After an embarrassing setback with the Galaxy Note 7, the Samsung Galaxy S8+ is promising to be a bigger and better phone you'll be proud to have. The smaller version, the Galaxy S8 has been a homerun for the company and they're hoping with a bigger screen, comes a better experience and a much-loved phone. Does it live up to hype? Let's find out in this review. Design and Build: Samsung phones have come a long way. Whereas the company initially developed phones with high end plastic, for the S8+, they've made sure to echo a more sophisticated look and quality by using a combination of glass and metal in its build. Overall Verdict: So is the Samsung S8+ worth considering if you're in the market for a new smartphone? The answer is a definite yes! If you love extra large screens, this one wins hands down. It's not too bulky but taller instead, the screen resolution is wonderful and will make you wonder why you even need a tablet at all. The aesthetics is sleek and beautiful without compromising on the quality or the function of the piece. I also love the iris scanner and camera quality. I just wish they had found a better placement for the fingerprint scanner because really, it renders a good scanner useless because of its awkward positioning. However, if there's one thing to rave about with the S8+, it's the battery life. I've never seen a phone last this long and I'm sure in the future, this is just going to get better.",5.0

1264,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"I have always been a fan of Samsung products. When I first got the S8, I was excited. Samsung Galaxy S8. 5.8 inches of AMOLED screen with almost no bezel. The screen is in a 18:9 aspect ratio compared to the movie standard of 16:9 so basically you will not get 5.8 inches of screen when watching videos. There will be black bars on the left and right of the screen. There is an option to crop it to fit the whole screen though. No problems with the screen being hard to read outdoors in sunlight. There is a fingerprint reader on the back of the phone that works wonderful. I never felt that it was hard to reach the spot to get it to work. The exterior of the S8 is mostly a glossy glass which is a big finger print magnet and is slippery to hold. A good case will fix this. An annoying thing I find myself doing is always accidentally pressing the ""Bixby"" button when I was wanting to adjust the volume. There is no physical home button or the capacitive buttons like on previous galaxy phones. Swiping up from the bottom of the screen brings up the buttons. Alarm clock has a neat feature where it will ring and have a voice prompt giving you the time and weather for the day. The ""Always on"" screen while phone is in standby mode is a great feature where it displays the time, date, and other useful informations but only displays in portrait mode. Standing it up on the side of the phone will not rotate the clock. All in All.... The new S8 is a good upgrade with great features. Sleek, thin and light phone with the best in class screens makes it worth it.",5.0

1267,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"I have spent 2 months, now, reading guides to JUST SET UP MY SETTINGS. It's impossible! I wanted to be able to give this phone a great review but, it's not really feasible. In all seriousness to disable notifications go to Settings > notifications Simple, right? Nope! Notification settings have 3 DIFFERENT pages of settings, that I have found, so far. Settings > Notifications Settings > Notifications > Advanced Settings Settings > Lock Screen and Security > Notifications Even still I receive notifications from apps with no permission to do so. Then, the icing on the cake, is that every hour certain apps GIVE THEMSELVES NOTIFICATION ACCESS! It's usually the apps that have notifications you can't swipe away. I have resigned myself to never being able to have a non-cluttered lock screen. Think about that and remember that Google Location keeps track of everywhere you go, and how you get there... sending it to a company famous for meticulously building a profile on YOU. ""So disable it, then!"" Well, other apps can remove my blockages so... Why the 1 stars? Features: You have to set up your features... and the settings are impossible to locate: it makes sense why google is so involved in this phone because, you're going to be Googling an awful lot to try setting this guy up. Performance: well, the settings are how you optomize performance... enough said. Design: The phone is capable of surviving an atomic bomb, it seems... and by the time you're done trying to configure it, you'll be begging to test that theory. The menus are part of program design and thus, all it's snazzy looks are outweighed by it's impractical layout. Value / Overall: the phone does whatever it wants and hides it's setting all over the place. It's like they started make menus and realized they forgot features on those menus. Instead of remaking the menu with all the relevant information in one place, they just kept adding menus. More than that half the menus are hats, on hats, on hats, with very little distinction between this menu or that... but hey the last menu didn't change anything so this one has to, right? Wrong. If you can't use it effectively it has no value.",1.0

I had a bad battery experience with my S6 edge plus battery so Samsung is really weak in battery area (Be aware if you use battery more). You have pay a huge service cost if battery goes bad even though it is not your fault. Also S6 phone design is far better than S8.,3.0

Times change though and this s8 plus is the perfect size for me, I watch movies all the time at work. Picture quality is excellent, the device is fast and has never froze. Compared to my note 7 there are many similarities, the look and feel are very close, however we don't have the battery issue. This is also the largest s series phone Samsung has produced only .1 inches smaller than the Note 8.

Cons: it ran slow at times--sometimes major lag, the front camera isn't all that, and it's a bit pricy Pros: again, the back camera is A1, the screen quality & colors are amazing (you can adjust these in the settings), you can customize the speakers (rock, pop, etc.), and the design is pretty cool.

When I talked to Samsung they basically said too bad, and when I talked to repair places it was $370 to get a new screen.

Weird screens open without touching it, sometimes the page gets big on its own, most of the time when I unlock it the phone will go to the call screen instead of the home screen even if the last thing I looked at was a website or an app. It's just annoying.

I don't care about the side features and how big the dang screen is. Actually it is to big now and will not fit into my breast pocket anymore and it to big to operate with one hand.

The only plus side about this phone is the AMAZING camera quality which is WHY I upgraded from my iPhone 7 to this(biggest mistake I ever made.) I would NOT recommend this phone to anyone.

1311,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"I once had a Samsung phone before this guy called the Samsung Transform. That thing was OK but ever-so... Problematic. Cheap speaker port, bad audio quality, bad quality for gaming, just ""use me for text messages and nothing else"" type of phone. So I was hesitant to get the S4-Mini when I was due for an upgrade a few years ago. Yet here I am, with my phone that's over 4 years old, and it's doing just fine. It's durable as all heck and the poor thing fell one too many times... Without a cracked screen to show for it (oh how tragic boohoo). It's just powerful enough to run games like Fire Emblem Heroes or display Youtube/Facebook. It can have these things saved in the background ready for use too. The battery life is fair, given all the stuff this little guy can handle, and it doesn't have overheating problems (but can get sizzly if you work it too hard for too long). The size feels just right. I can leave it in my pocket as a bluetooth speaker picks up what music is playing for up to 30 feet (I think more than that too). I honestly don't know how Samsung makes money if they make these things so durable and practically future proof. I'm sure there are more powerful phones, but if I wanted a phone that could do a million things... Well... Um... I'm pretty sure that's what I'd use my Desktop for. I use my phone for searching the Internet, playing/getting music, playing mobile games, and checking Social Media. I don't need it to do my taxes, find my soul mate, and play The Fast And The Furious 24 simultaneously. lol Given it's age it doesn't exactly feature the Performance or Features of a newer phone, so sadly I can only give this sweet baby a 4/5 for those categories.",5.0

Everything from PRO to night time taking, etc. I have gone through water, the pool, rain, etc. and not any damage. It truly is a water resistant phone, of course up specifications^^ But every app and button responds rapidly.

All of which outperformed the Note 3 I had been using before, but not as amazing as the Note 7. Waterproof? You bet! I take it underwater with me while shooting photos and video. The only thing I'd change if I could: turn screen sensitivity off while underwater somehow, using the volume buttons to start and stop video, take photos, and whatever else.

1368,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"Don't get me wrong, I love my phone. There are points in time where I have no problems with it what so ever. However, there are far too many times that I have to suffer from the functional errors of the device. To start with, I only got this device again because it was cheaper than buying another phone when the one I originally had, decided not to turn on again. What makes that even better, is the fact that all of my supposedly backed up files, were no where to be found. I lost all of my information that is very crucial to my everyday life. No one would even offer to look at my phone to see if there was any hope for fixing it and restoring all of my lost data. Anyways, before my phone shut off for good, the battery would drain quickly, everything would freeze up, it would shut on and off in the middle of what I was doing. I'm certainly not the only one who uses their phone for work and when I'm in the middle of something important, it'd be nice to be able to finish it without disruptions.

1385,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"I have been a Samsung Galaxy loyalist since the S III. I owned the S III, S5, S7, and now S8. I was really excited when I got the S8 but I am returning it to Verizon under the 15-day return rule for a new S7. The taller screen on the S8 gives amazing space and the display is gorgeous . I didn't get around to doing much with Bixby. Beyond that, I see few differences to the S7 but that's not why I'm returning it. I'm returning because of 2 glaring deficiencies that make it intolerable to keep. 1.) BATTERY - it takes forever to charge compared to my S7 (using brand new cord provided with the phone) and the battery drains much faster than my prior S7. It says it is fast charging but always underestimates the amount of time to fully charge, which is about 3 hours. I thought I had a defective phone but an internet search reveals the unfortunate fact that many are complaining about this and I am too dependent on my cell to await a software fix (if that's even possible and forthcoming as some have suggested). 2.) TOUCH SCREEN - with a tempered glass front cover on, you have to touch REALLY hard to get the screen to respond . It sometimes takes me 3 to 4 attempts of PUNCHING a button hard to make it respond; ditto for sliding the screen, particularly top to bottom. Again, an internet search found countless others expressing this same problem. Users who took the screen cover off don't have this problem but given that I have cracked the glass cover on prior phones more than once (and assumedly saved my glass phone in the process), I am not willing to take it off and risk breaking my very expensive phone. Tech user responses to this problem are that due to the curved edges of the phone, the tempered glass can't sit as well and is the cause of the problem. Two less important annoyances are that the power button is much harder to press than the S7 and I HATE the time which appears on two lines on the ""always on screen"" and there are no built-in alternatives. There are however some apps with different option in the Google Play Store. Finally, I have to say it again - can we just stick to a standard charging type. When you have two or more people in the same house/car, having different chargers for each one is SUCH a pain. Well, I have loved every odd numbered Samsung so hopefully the S9 will again be all that I have come to expect from a Samsung phone.",2.0

I have never broken a phone screen in the past 10 or more years. Three months in with my new highly hyped S8+ I knocked my phone (with a Mophie battery phone case on it) off a coffee table at home onto a tile floor and now I have broken screen. 4 months in and the fingerprint scanner isn't working.

1427,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"The Galaxy S5 is an amazing phone, capable of so much. However, if you buy the Verizon or AT&T models you get a crippled version. You cannot root or unlock them, they were specifically manufactured to prevent it. I don't blame Samsung, they wanted Verizon and AT&T's business and this was the only way they could make phones for them. This also applies to the MVNO carriers that use Verizon's or AT&'s network, so do your homework before buying a phone. I can't even get a newer version of android than 4.4.2, it is now August of 2017! I will never buy another phone from a carrier again, so much better to buy unlocked direct from the manufacturer.

Supports up to 256gb external storage which is a big pro for this phone because not many competitors had that storage capacity. The 3,600 mAh battery gives me hours of battery life and can't be more pleased with it. The display ratio makes the display larger without making the device itself bulky.

1448,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"When the S8 models were released in the States I felt a bit dejected because this market was limited to black, silver, and orchid Grey colors despite knowing that other colors that were popular here were being sold over seas. I had purchased three coral blue beauty in the Note7 and S7 Edge editions and knew that buying the S8+ in any other color would leave me wanting for more, specifically in a shade of blue. There's something about Samsung's shade of blue, when applied to their stellar designed smart phones that's pure magic. At initial release I purchased an orchid grey S8+, and once the coral blue model was announced for the States I made plans to get this amazing phone in the shade I truly wanted, which I did yesterday Sunday, July 23rd. I also ordered Samsung's blue protective case, which arrived a day after I purchased my phone. I haven't been to stop admiring the beauty of this phone, Its definitely one of the few mobile phones thatI can see myself holding on to as a collector's item (I simply adore well designed and functioning, cutting edge tech). Having owned they orchid S8+ meant that I was familiar with all the features packed into the S8 series phones. Even still it's a joy to reintroduce myself to these features that still amaze me. The iris scanner has to be one of my favorite biometric tools for securing my phone. It's a great option to have when you may be unable to scan your finger print, or input a pin number. The multiple ways to unlock the S8 is very impressive, and technologywise goes far beyond any other smart phone on the market today. It's great that Samsung is offering theS8 carrier unlocked, which frees consumers from being tethered to one carrier, something extremely important in the US, where the customer service you get can be quite bad from all 4 to 5 of the major carriers. It's a good feeling to know that you aren't obligated to remain with a company that provides poor service. Additionally, Samsung's unlocked phones are sold free of the extra, unnecessary applications that each carrier adds to phones locked on their network. That performance of the S8 phones is matched only by their cutting edge design. You won't find an Android phone that comes close to the high quality performance, and pioneering design of Samsung's flagship embassy phones. The only suggestion I have for current or future owners of Samsung Galaxy phones is to take care of your phone. They are true investments that maintain a high percentage of their original value/price, for years after your initial purchase.",5.0

The OS is over-complicated and isn't fun to use. There are too many options, too many intrusions, and Samsung's apps are irritating. The whole point of using Android is customizing the OS to use what we want, and it's near impossible to get by without google or Samsung being rammed in every aspect of the phone. Bixby is absolutely worthless. We have enough assistants and never needed another one. Clearly it's a money grab from Samsung, which makes sense, but if we don't want to use it, we shouldn't have to. The dedicated button is unnecessary and easily bumped during regular use. If I want to use Cortana, I shouldn't be circumvented by Samsung's terrible software.",3.0

1467,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"Screen is definitely the highlight of this upgrade. however, that's about it compared to the very well rounded and capable S7. i will focus on the negatives which is most people care about when considering upgrading: 1. rounded screen looks nice but not very practical. it is slippery and hard to hold on to. i always avoid ""edge"" version of the galaxy phones but with S8, i have no choice. the S8 renders the color in a much warmer manner. it almost feel like used with that yellowish tune on display. 2. Sound quality. i thought this wont be a big deal but i completely changed my mind after comparing my ""old"" phone, the Axon 7 to S8. the speakerphone, headphone and bluetooth experience on Axon 7 is way superior than S8 in both recording and play back. if anything made me start to regret this ""upgrade"", it will be the sound quality. 3. Finger print scanner - no doubt it was a dumb design to put it besides the camera, everyone agreed right? it is also much slower than Axon 7 4. no physical ""home"" keys - it just slows me down in operating the phone. in addition, samsung did't do a good job utilizing the extra space after removing the physical keys. the screen is bigger but the app icons are actually smaller. i was staring at the beautify wall paper and wondering which icon was calendar and which one was calculator. what's the point? 5. software- full of bloat ware as usual. replacement of google now by Bixby and samsung voice recognition was sub-par and the ""smart switch"" app did not work for Axon 7 .",3.0

My old S5 lasted for years like a champ, so it was extremely disappointing to find this ""new and improved"" model turn out to be so delicate. If I ignore the cracked screen, the S8 is great in its performance, battery life, etc. But it's a shame that you apparently have to put a bulky protector over the good-looking, sleek design in order to protect it.

Unfortunately, the phone fell off a chair where I was seated (about a two foot drop), hit concrete and the screen is now cracked. I dug a little further an it seems I'm not the only one with this issue as the screen durability has come into question by many others. Buyer beware, it will break.",1.0
1492,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"I'm really loving my S8+ so far. The overall design and performance has been great for me so far. Camera I switched from an iPhone 7 Plus which is often touted as having the best camera. I really did love the camera on it but I've actually been more impressed with the camera in the s8 than I was anticipating. The first shot I took with my camera instantly sold me on it. It was a fairly low light show of my new cat and it came out sharp and vibrant. Similar shots taken with my previous phone came out grainy and with colors that weren't very accurate. Performance The performance has been really great so far. I haven't experienced an serious lag or anything. The battery life has been really great. I have to use my personal phone for work purposes throughout the day and I can make it 2 days without charging it. DEX One of the main things that interested me in the S8 is/was Samsung DEX. It's a dock that allows you to hook the S8 to a monitor, keyboard, and mouse and basically makes it function like a desktop computer. It has a special UI that activates when it's plugged into the DEX which closely resembles either Windows or Chrome OS. There are a number of apps that function like a desktop version like Microsoft Office, Gmail, and Chrome or Samsung Interbrowsers. The functionality has been great for me so far. The performance actually seems even better when plugged into the DEX for some reason and I've been especially impressed with the brower performance and smooth scrolling. Many apps only load as small phone sized versions. I'm hoping this will change over time. The biggest disappoitments are video services like Netflix. This would be an ideal use for them for me but they load in a tiny phone sized window and you can't view the video fullscreen. Youtube does work as a desktop version though. Overall, I really love my DEX and look forward to conitnued improvements to it. Overall, this is a really amazing phone and I can't recommend it enough.",5.0

The phone is always facing up on my nightstand or is in a special pocket in my purse with no other items. My screen protector is coming in today, but I didn't imagine already getting a scratch. For a phone this high priced, the screen should not be so easily damaged. I have had phones for almost two years with no scratches. Thinking about returning.",3.0

1499,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"The best part of this device, which separates it from previous Samsung and most other android and iOS devices is the larger screen size. This larger screen size is not only aesthetically pleasing, but it is far more efficient than physical home and back buttons. The only negative I have with this phone is the lack of a IR blaster.

1501,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"It's a beautiful phone. No doubt. In throws in some additional gimmicky features such as iris-scan, the heart-rate monitor, and the edge lighting, which are not exactly necessary for a phone, but if you're paying that much for a phone, these become ""nice to have"" features. The curved screen is a little pointless, to be honest, other than being a novelty. In fact, the curved edge creates glare which makes items harder to read when for example the phone is mounted in a car. Some people have complained about the fingerprint scanner's location. It's not ideal, but it has been working okay for me, so far. Android purists such as myself will not be very happy with the following: 1. Some very common widgets simply don't display correctly on this phone. They display perfectly fine on other Android phones, but not on this, possibly due to the aspect ratio. 2. Bixby is awful and unnecessary. It is essentially the re-inventing of the wheel. The fact that it tries to take over existing functionality essentially cripples the phone in doing things which offered better integration had they left it alone. 3. The Launch Bixby button is dedicated to... Bixby - a terrible restriction on the user. 4. The all-white theme that is forced upon the user. This makes notifications indistinguishable. I would not have bothered to write this review and even tolerated some of the other flaws had it not been for the fact that Bixby is being forced on the user. I have lost the tight voice recognition functionality that I used to have with my previous device.",2.0

This new s8+ has some decent qualities and some programming that sucks, pretty much takes control of preference, you have to give permission to pretty much everything before it let's you do simple preference displays, or other tasks.

1572,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"The interface on the Samsung Edge 7 has been tweaked until the point is it plain unfriendly. (Running Android 7.0 / Nougat) Before all the useless ""improvements"" to the interface, I could quickly re-call a dropped call by a single push of a button. Now, I have to fumble around, hit the name I want to call, look at the lightly-labeled drop-down menu, and look for a tiny little phone receiver symbol to recall. There used to be a bold, well-displayed list of recent calls on Galaxy phones. Now I must look through hard-to-see lists underneath two tabs, then select ""Recent"" vs ""Contacts."" If i wanted to look for a list of contacts, I would hit the contact book icon. I just want a straight shot at re-calling someone with one button click. The Edge 7 has also made me unhappy with the inability to select whether an app goes to the internal storage or the SD/card. Every time I update the apps, I must then go through the entire moving of app or app storage to the card. This week, it started giving me a black screen and that is unacceptable if you need to turn off a ringer in a meeting. My Edge 7 gets hot for unknown reasons and slower with every update. The battery is draining faster than it should. I have have cleaned up my system cache file and the app cache files. The only thing I haven't done on this phone is a factory reset. It's wasted enough of my time. I will soon go get another phone that just WORKS. Two years ago, I bought a Nexus as my housephone when I purchased a Project Fi phone number and service. It glides along like a dream. No bloatware. No heating up. Never stutters. It's running Nougat, too. Yet, I can call anyone with ONE click of a large button! So, I know that phones can be better than Samsung's offerings. I will hate to leave. I was a diehard...I had a Galaxy, Galaxy 2, then Notes 2,3,and 4, and finally, the fateful Note 7, then STILL I stayed with Samsung and took the Edge 7 until the Note 8 would come out. But, in the last six months, Samsung has turned into a phone that isn't anything like the reason I have bought them for nearly a decade. Sure, I still WANT a Note 8, but I know it will be another phone where with each update it slows down and the menus are so fancy you can't see them. It will come with the overly-improved interface on the latest Android OS and it will be stuffed to the gills with unwanted apps that slow down my phone.

Comparing the S8 to any other phone aesthetically is impossible. It is just beautiful.

1590,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"Love everything about this phone except the buttons get in my way when I use the landscape mode and, like most phones, the back is too slippery and needs rubber strips or something to keep it from sliding from your hand so easily. It looks sleek and stunning but slippery is not a good trait on a products that are as pricey as these hand-held gadgets and a bit of practicality is a useful thing in product design. I love the water resistant feature of the S8+ but I haven't had it long enough to know how well the unchangeable battery is going to hold up over time. The phone is remarkably light and hand-friendly. I'm a Samsung fan moving from a Note4, which has really held up well, so I hope the quality of this phone holds up as well over time. I recommend the S8+ if you're looking for speed, good looks, and the Samsung experience.",5.0

1604,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"I have had all three curved screen phones S6 edge, S7 edge and S8+. I have yet to have any issues with screens as stated in a couple reviews I have read. The screens are tough and don't scratch easily. I did have a cracked screen on my S6 but any other brand would have been broken much worse. The phone still functions perfectly even with the cracks. I am very hard on my phones working and dropping the phone every day. Why would anyone ever use a smart phone without a protective case. Which brings me to complaints about finger prints on the back glass not a problem on any phone I have ever had. All my phones have been protected by a case. If you want to show off the beauty of your phone get one of the clear cases that are available then you have the best of both worlds. As for the fingerprint scanner it is in the perfect space, much better placement than other phones I have tried with the scanner in the middle area of the back. As for putting smudges on the camera lens that is pretty hard to do unless you have peanut butter and jelly on your finger. I have tried to smudge my camera lens with just my finger and cannot smudge it to any degree that would ever cause a lack of picture quality. My opinion is people will complain about just about anything if its a valid complaint or not. As for locating the scanner without looking it is very easy to locate if you are right handed, it may be a different story if you are a lefty but I don't know about that. My case has a beveled edge near the scanner that makes it extremely easy to place your finger on the scanner. The iris scanner is the best method to use but everyone has their preferences. The plus size is not that large and easy to use with one hand or well with my hands anyway which are of normal size. It took me a while to warm up to no home button but I'm getting use to using the power button to open and close my desktop. While I'm on the home button I don't see where eliminating it gave any more screen area. The area where the button was is now taken by the on screen buttons so that area of the screen is still taken up by buttons. It does look much sleeker and modern but didn't give any more usable screen space. As for Bixby or the lack there of, I'm not getting it. I don't see Bixby ever being anything better than Goggle assistant so what's the big hoopla. At this point it's nothing more than another widget that I'll never use. The Bixby button should have been the new home button. Maybe Samsung will pull it off but I don't see it being anything to hold your breath on. I have an issue with the S8 using Samsung Pay, it just doesn't work anymore. I am a big user of Samsung Pay but with my new phone it's not working, I always get your card is declined, very disappointing. Now I'm back to using my card and loosing points on Samsung Pay. It is still working on my other phone but not the S8, it is so hit or miss I have given up entirely I hate holding up the line, very disappointing. Even the latest update that was just pushed down has not fixed the issue. The phone battery is average on usage, better than my S6 worse than my S7 but it last most the day and I don't play games or do other heavy usage and screen is turned down. With always on display turned on it makes it through the day but not much more than that. I have turned off always on display and have about 40 percent at around 6pm. Fast charge has always been a plus on all my S phones and wireless charging charges in good time. The phone is fast and works smooth it's the best performance I have seen on any phone. I do like the new phone and feel it is the best thing going at this point in time. I have no worries about the battery it's a shame they had the Note 7 problem and I get tired of people asking aren't you afraid the phone is going to blow up. Bye Bye Samsung phones if that happens, so I'm pretty sure they have done everything to make their batteries trouble free. I've had my S7 for a year or so and it has had no problems with screen performance or battery so I'm 100 percent confident that the S8 is going...",5.0

1610,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"This Samsung Galaxy S8 is the greatest piece of technology I own to this day, and I do have serveral lol. But from the design of the phone, the performance, and all around ease of use all while being simplistic yet sophisticated, IT IS FANTASTIC. My first Samsung Galaxy phone was the S3, from there I fell in love with Samsungs' design, functionality, and customization as compared to other big name brand companies, I'd take a Samsung every single time. The S8s' display is super clear, crisp, bright, and eye catching. Watching videos are wonderful and picture quality is outstanding. Samsung did a brilliant job with this phone and I am so glad that I purchased it. Keep Up the Amazing Work Samsung! I'll be a customer for life.",5.0
1611,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"This phone is amazing. It's slick, fast and gorgeous. The display is great, even if you use the standard setting instead of enhanced. Bixby: Bixby has a long way to go to replacing already-existing assistants on the market. It's too early in development to really comment on whether this will become a commonly used application. Security: I'm not completely inconvenienced by the fingerprint scanner, but when I can avoid it I much prefer to use the iris scan. It actually works rather well and saves me the hassle of searching for the scanner, and it's more secure. Battery: The battery life is decent, but the power-saving mode is awesome. My phone lasted on single charge, from 3AM until 10PM, mid-power-save mode, and still had plenty of juice left if I'd needed it. I wasn't heavily using it (during that time I took some photos, chatted on messenger, and browsed social media sites) but I've had plenty of phones die on me with little to no use just due to how long I'd gone without a charge. It's also really convenient to turn on and off, right there in your quick action tray. Speakers: The speakers are decent but I'm not thoroughly impressed. I much prefer using my headset or a bluetooth speaker when available. That being said, dual bluetooth support is an exciting new feature I can't wait to try out. Camera: Great quality and tons of new fun and useful features. Definitely a must-have as phones have replaced the standard digital camera. Overall, I love this phone and it's definitely worth the upgrade. It may not be perfect, but it is easy to overlook the few imperfections.",5.0

1621,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"Galaxy s8+ is arguably the best looking phone out currently. And feels great in my hands. The screen is out of this world and I have a hard time taking my eyes off of it. This is my first Samsung android phone. I've always had iPhones but with release of the s8 I just had to give it a try. So far I am not regretting that decision one bit. I was afraid the switch would be painful especially with my entire family on iPhones but the switch was actually very smooth. So far loving the design, screen, camera, performance... don't really have any major gripes. One minor thing is the face recognition does not work reliably, more often than not it does not recognize me. I have tried to recapture my face multiple times in different light settings but it still does not work 100%. But does not bother me much as I'm mostly using the fingerprint and smart lock(great feature!).",5.0

1623,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"So these days its getting harder and harder to get excited about a new cell phone. They have all started to look much the same and there haven't been any really out of this world additions in several years. That being said I would say this is the best-looking phone out currently and the specs equally are better than anything else out there as a holistic package. Sure a camera here might be better, or the screen more durable, but all things included this is the best there is as of today. I like that they stuck with the water resistance and that the drop protection has been enhanced a bit more than the last two models. In fact while getting used to the new phone (and before I put a skin on the back) the thing slipped out of my hand twice. It was pretty without any protection but WAY too slippery...once it landed onto a concrete floor the other time onto a tile floor with no damage noted. I have since installed a grippier skin on the back. The only complaint I have is the fingerprint scanner having been put on the back. When the phone is on a table or desk, with my S6 I could unlock it without having to pick it up. Now I have to deal with the unlock code or I have to pick it up...neither of which is as convenient. Anyway...all in all very happy (sans the fingerprint scanner) and I would definitely buy this phone again.",5.0

I've always had Samsung Galaxy phones (S3 through S6) & this is my least favorite upgrade. It's got all of the amazing normal features like best quality camera, etc, but I don't like the lack of home button, or the option to have normal vs edge, & while you can change the clock format on the always on display, it won't change on the normal lock screen (and if you're type A maybe a little OCD, that will drive you nuts). My biggest complaint though is the button sensitivity - you can change home button sensitivity but whether I'm typing or scrolling for normal everyday use, I feel like I'm going to break the screen because I have to press so hard & it takes me twice as long to type or even play solitaire because it skipped a letter or something. Also, while I realize most people want the uber slim design, I wish the S8 had width of the S8+ but height of the S8.

Not worth the money and would have kept my S7 edge if I knew I was going to have these problems. Definitely a manufacturer defect not a accidental damage.

1651,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"To be honest the overall of a 4 is rather harsh considering my reasons. My two main reasons for the 4 rating are that they don't have gifs built into the Samsung keyboard as well as the overall price. Every other Android Phone I have ever had, has had the gifs built into the keyboard and it is one of the weirdest, but also my favorite things about owning an android phone vs a iPhone. However, everything else is spot on. The phone is lightning fast, battery life is awesome, and the fingerprint reader that everyone seems to complain about really isn't in as bad of a location as they make it out to be. Once you get used to it you hardly notice it. I can understand for people that take lots of pictures because you do accidentally touch the camera lens using it but it really isn't noticeable for me.

From there till now I had to other phones, but still wasn't happy till now that I'm back to my Galaxy S8+. This phone is awesome to watch videos on. Full screen view is amazing, split screen is easy to use with apps that allow it. The fingerprint reader on the back is sweet. I don't know what the first tech guys were complaining about online when Samsung put this on the back next to the camera. It's much easier for me to use my finger on the back than try and curl my thumb back to do it on the front like some phones that have the fingerprint reader on the home button. The performance has been amazing in most apps. The camera and integrated scanner - Bixby, is a great addition to explore or to just take some great pics and videos. Battery life is what I would expect from a big phone like this. Lasting me all day with the same kind of use that I would put my previous phones through, emails, FB, and other apps usage. Only thing I really am not a fan of is the headphone jack is on the bottom. But the AKG headset that came with the phone sound great and they work just as great. Fast charging is quick to charge the phone all the way without spending half the day doing it. Overall can't say enough good things about it from the little bit of time I've had it. Keep up the good work Samsung. Thanks",5.0
1660,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"I just got my Galaxy S7 a month ago and am still impressed with it's performance and looks. The case is the slimmest I've held, and though a bit slick, I haven't managed to drop it yet. The elegance of the silky smooth case gives the S7 a quality feel which IMO offsets the lack of grip, and is negated by addition of a protective case anyway, so the point is moot. Though I do keep it un-cased at home just to enjoy the smooth elegance of the design. It's fast and battery life, while it could be a lot better isn't the worst. The bloatware is a little ridiculous and you'd think there would be better alternatives than voiding the warranty to have fewer resource hogging, worthless apps taking up space and battery life. Carriers, please: as expensive as this phone is, there has to be a way to disable the bloat! The screen is typical Samsung marvelous quality, with sharp detail and crisp colors. The camera takes excellent photos as long as you hold really still. Lots of bells and whistles everywhere! I wish the apps and gallery would really store items on the external memory like I tell them to, but if you crop a photo, onto the phone storage it goes; a habit which can at some point impede performance. overall, these are small nags and even being able to send things to your memory card once again, as opposed to a virtual SD card is HUGE! Thank you for fixing that mistake! Bottom line, this phone does everything I need it to very well, voice is clear, photos are sharp, and the Android OS continues to beat IOS IMO. For a buyer looking for options at less than front row price, this is the phone you need.",5.0

I was quite skeptical about change , having to acclimatize to a new phone etc.. i must tell you.. with the S8 and the smart switch the transition was perfect..i get excited each day i pick up my phone ... I know its a new phone but i still got everything i had before.. just that they work faster and smoother... This is one of those kinds of sweet changes i guess you never regret... All i can say is its perfect so far.",5.0

1679,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,I was so disappointed when my Note 7 had to be returned 2 times. I did however faithfully wait for the release of the S8. Many sales people tried to talk me into another manufacturer during the interim release period. I am a Samsung believer and could not be swayed. I love my new phone and am slowly getting familiar with all its possibilities. Will there be a SD card release? I installed a 256 MB card because that was all that is available currently.,5.0
1680,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"This is an amazing phone! It doesn't have all the accidental touches like on the S7 edge. everything from game play to transitions and opening and closing apps is super fast. What impresses me the most is the battery life. I average over 5 hrs of screen on time. the 835 chipset is awesome. IT feels real good in the and and the FPS is way better than on the S7 edge. I didn't give it 5 stars because the Bixby button doesn't always work. Also, How can you brag about Bixby and then release the phone with a half-baked version. I was looking forward to using it. Furthermore, Bixby vision needs to be refined in regards to accuracy. more often than not it gets the picture wrong. Other than that I am extremely pleased with this product so far.",4.0

1682,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"I just got my S8 plus in Orchid Grey and its such a nice design. I was fortunate enough before it was released to the public to know someone that works for Samsung and I saw it about 1 month ago. Now that I have it, I am enjoying the infinity screen and how things look on there. I am not as big a techie as some others but I am big on sound quality and let me tell you that the sound is great. I can sit somewhere without headphones and be entertained if I wanted. The camera is my favorite and when I say that the pictures are in high HD with professional quality I mean just that. I have not had any issues with the phone recognizing me as I have heard non-android users suggest. I updated from a Notebook 4 and was going to get the 7 but unfortunately had to wait. Well, I am more than happy and can not wait to play around with the Bixby features and various set ups on the phone. I'm excited and did I say its a cute phone. It absolutely is...",4.0

1684,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,Like I said its GREAT! But also please don't do what I did and not put a screen protector on this guy just a few days after opening I got some micro scratches all over the screen. Nothing to damaging but very annoying. Thank goodness for Premium plus care! But over all the phone is great it does lag from time to time but if you know your way around android it would be an easy fix.,5.0

There is one thing I don't like about this phone though, the speaker is on the bottom instead of the back. When I hold it, my pinkie is always covering it up. When I put it in my pocket or purse holder, I have to make sure I put it up side down or I won't hear it ring. Only a little pain in the hiney though.",5.0

Its ben 3 days and I'm amazed every day with everything I find this phone does that my iPhone couldn't hold a candle to. My S6 edge outperformed my iPhone 6s on every level. The S8+ makes my friends iPhone 7's look foolish. Never leaving Samsung again.",5.0

1701,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"It is a very attractive phone....several people have already commented on its good looks (although I thought my S6 was even prettier). In between the S6 and S8, I had a Windows Phone, which had some superior qualities to the S8 (the camera had 20MP and was better), but I am back to Android for the better apps. I am hoping to master this phone and keep it for four years before the next big upgrade. However, its use is not as intuitive as I would have liked....I am forced to download the manual, to take advantage of all its capabilities.

1706,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"Here is my feedback based on my experience with this phone so far: CONS: - Severely overpriced - Different charging tip, therefore no longer able to use micro USB chargers. ALSO, there was no charging adapter, which should've come with the phone, at least the first generation of this change. - No physical HOME button (I loved this feature on the previous Samsung phones) - EDGE screen has limitations with the inability to expand. I regularly used the Quick Menu option on the Note4 (multiple times a day) which had the ability to be modified and expanded. The new EDGE Apps screen has a maximum of 10 apps that can be added - this is unreasonable and inefficient. I'm already having issues multi-tasking with this phone and it's been less one week! - When viewing a contact, must click multiple times to view the contact details. This change was absolutely illogical. - No longer able to get to the phone keypad from the Contacts. - Waterfall edge screen causes issues when handling and typing. The small lip that was on previous phones created a good buffer. I wish I had the option to get a phone without this edge screen. - Bixby was not released yet the phone price remained the same. - Fingerprint scanner is adjacent to the camera lens on the back of the phone, how does this make sense??? The scanner should've been on the front for ease of use without impacting other features and functions. PROS: - Slick design - Beautiful and vibrant screen - Large internal capacity, 64GB - SD card slot - Earphone jack Thank you.",3.0

1710,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"I've had my S8+ for a week now. It's spelled the end of battery anxiety. I regularly close out the day with 50 or 60% remaining charge which is a huge improvement from my S7. Great screen, good usability. Excellent switching from previous models (I just switched my boss from iPhone and that was also simple). Really it's hard to fault the S8+. It's pricey but you definitely get what you pay for. With a 256GB memory card added in I can have all of my content on board wherever I go. The AKG headphones bundled in also have excellent sound quality. The only thing I'm not mad about are the two different materials on the cable. It's fabric most of the way but old school rubber to the earpieces.",5.0

1718,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,"I have only had the phone for 2 days and am seriously considering returning it. my phones for the last 4 years have been droids and I have been real happy with them. I always seemed to be getting the phones late meaning the next version came out within months of me getting a new phone. I was eligible for a new phone when the 8S came out so I thought I would give it a try. i seem to be having a lot of problem with the touch screen. Having to tap an icon several times to get it to select. the info bar at the top of the screen is the worst. now i installed the update and i keep getting a DQA stopped working notice comming up on the screen. i tried several of the fixes i found on line. the first one i tried seemed to work but then it started again the next morning. now i have tried wiping the cache, the first time no help so tried to wipe it a 2nd time and it seems to have fixed it or at least for the last hour and a half. I have 14 days to return it and if it does not get any better I probably will.",2.0
1719,Google Shopping,Samsung S8,I just got the Galaxy 8 and the screen was a little narrower than I expected. The screen is really solid and the phone responses super fast. No waiting for it to think about opening a app. Google maps sees much faster too in locating my position which is a plus on my commute. It is has very little weight to it. The one thing that I don't like right now is that it is very slippery when holding it. There are no corners/edges to get a grip on it. I am hoping after a get a protective case that it will help with this.,4.0

Before that it was an iPhone which I loved till it broke from there I went to the S6 and never looked back, Ive wanted this phone ever since there were rumors about it online. Even after the Note 7 disaster I still had hope and preordered the S8 first chance I got. The design is great, I have no problems with anything, I have not tried out the iris or face recognition yet. The clock on it kinda bugs me as the hours are on top and the minutes are below that and I don't know how to change it, Ive looked everywhere in the settings but it is a minor issue.

The battery life is great (who doesn't want a longer life, though?) I love the battery save options, as well as the RAM cleaner. My ONLY complaint, is Bixby. I understand that there are people who would benefit from its features, but it's just not for me.

429,Google Shopping,iPhone 8,"So my daughter's iphone 5c was aging, being nearly 4 years old, and my iPhone 6 stopped working correctly, and I'm watching the lawsuit against Apple with glee. I wanted to go Samsung, but she loves apple, so I took one for the team, fully charged my ""6"" so it would work when evaluated for trade in, and got this phone as the 'buy one' part of the special AT&T was running under their Next program. Of course, my '6' was a 64Gb, and was nearly full after 3 1/2 years, so I sort of talked myself into getting the 256Gb beast. Apple could simplify all of our lives (theirs and ours) by just providing a slot for a standard memory expansion card (micro SD?) like other makers do for Android phones. Would make transferring or printing photos ever so much less sucky. BB staff was decent to work with, although some of the conversations between team members about disciplinary discussions were kind of unprofessional. Keep that stuff in the break room please.",3.0

474,Google Shopping,iPhone 8,"I was convinced last year I would buy the new iPhone X when it was released. All the leaked photos, specs, etc., made it my clear choice of my new upgrade. Then I went into Best Buy and actually held the X. First impressions: it's small. But this is because I have always used the plus sized phones when possible. Screen looked great. However, when I pulled up some videos and did a side-by-side comparison with the 8s Plus, I knew I wanted the 8. The screens look identical with great resolutions. Colors are bright and vivid, even ""crisp"" if that is word that can be used to describe colors. But, despite the fact that the X screen is just slightly larger than the 8s Plus, the videos were smaller. Much smaller. This is because of the screen ratio being slightly less wide than the 8s Plus. For me, this alone was the deal breaker. I can do without the talking emojis. That would get old for me real quick. I like seeing my screen big and bright. The X is bright, big, but not when it comes to videos, Netflix, etc. That's really the only drawback. Oh, and my 8s Plus was $200 less. Sold.",5.0

I still prefer the size of the iPhone 5 at this point. For some reason,the phone seems to require more data than my previous phone. This phone seems to make more mistakes in “talk to text“ then my previous phone, but maybe it will get used to my speech after a while. It made about 15 mistakes as I tried to “talk to text” this review, for example. The battery also seems to deplete quicker than I expected.

I have never put a screen protector on any of my iPhone and I have never had scratches. The phone is in my side pocket of my purse, my back pocket, or on my desk. The first iPhone 8 scratched within the first few weeks. My replacement scratched quickly also.

I waited at the store for 3 hours only to be told that my texts, pictures, self added music and ringtones could not be transferred and that the newer tranfering medium does not allow that, everything on the new one cost $$.

779,Google Shopping,iPhone 8,"The phone is very nice, but depending on what you are using right now, it may not be worth the upgrade. Comparing the 8 to the 6 that I have, there are definite improvements in the fingerprint access, the camera, and the speed. But these are incremental, and you really have to decide if a second here and there is worth it. Looking at actual printed pictures from both phones, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. They both are more than acceptable to me. Yes, the 8 has more features, but again, are they worth it to you? Sitting the 2 phones side by side, you really can't tell the difference, especial;;y since I have the same case on both. My suggestion is that going from a 6 to the 8, probably makes sense. However, if you have a 6S, or a 7, (the 8 is actually a 7S), I would probably hold off a year and see what direction Apple takes with the X.

I have looked at the new Samsung note 8 and screen was so so much better and also pics looked way better but I have never had Samsung phone and don’t feel like trying to learn all that new stuff so I just decided on iPhone again more for convince than anything else.

887,Google Shopping,iPhone 8,I went from the 5s to the 8plus. Big difference in size of course but really notice the sound when I am on the phone. Much clearer now. Although I think the 7plus is jsut as good. I went to the AT&T store asking for the 7plus but only had the same gold color. They had it in Black but a 8plus. Good way up up selling I think? First thing I did was to get the Otterbox. Fits both 7 and 8plus. Pictures are good. I guess I really didn't see the big difference some people say there is. Much faster when charging and battery lasts longer. Bigger screen means more aps on my first page. I do have beats headphones that plug in so I need to sue their adapter which is included. Not a big deal because I only sue them on the plane flights. All in all a good move. The price is a bit steep but I don't plan on upgrading for another few years.,5.0
888,Google Shopping,iPhone 8,It’s a typical Apple product. Runs buttery smooth as usual. The battery life seems surprisingly well for the size of it. Had the 7 Plus for a few months before going to the other top competitor. Still having it on a different carrier and the 8 you can’t really go wrong with any of them anymore. I would and do recommend the iPhone 8 to friends family and foes alike!! Bought the gold version this go around more of a cream with a champagne aluminum ring. Wireless charging is a go it works with my Samsung charger with no problems. Mainly bought this for the iMessage to communicate with a few of my friends and family.

903,Google Shopping,iPhone 8,"No joke, iPhone 8 is pretty much identical to the iPhone 7 (they even use the exact same cases) just a bit of an upgrade like wireless charging (which I’ll probavly never use) and from what it seems, better lighting and a slightly better camara. Don’t get me wrong, I like my iPhone 8 (64gb), but you can pretty much get an iPhone 7 with 128gb for about the same price as the iPhone 8. That’s why I recommend, if you have an iPhone 6 and you’re trying to upgrade I’ll say get the 8 if you want the slightly better features, but if you’re looking for space defiantly get the 7. if you already have the iPhone 7, I wouldn’t even bother wasting money, just stick with it.

Overall again if you want same old design same old Screen, same old software, same old stuff go for it.. the last thing I’m going to say is the one feature I really like is this It has fast charging.. 0-100 percent in 1 hour and 50 mins , the regular charging takes 0-100 percent in 2 hours and 30 Mins....the only downside to this is that you will have to spend more money to get the usb type C cord and Type C wall adaptor...is it really worth buying the usb type C chargers the answer is yes. But overall would not recommend this iPhone at all.. go with something else that offers more and that offers a better upgrade for your cash........",1.0
971,Google Shopping,iPhone 8,Upgraded from the 6 to the 8 64gb. The battery life seems to be way better and the speed is fantastic and I am enjoying the “live”pictures wireless charging works very well.,5.0
972,Google Shopping,iPhone 8,The iPhone 8 is very fast and easy to use. Battery life is excellent and I really like the look and overall design. Call quality is excellent. I have no complaints about this phone at all.,5.0

974,Google Shopping,iPhone 8,"Got this in gold (256 gb) and I love it. Upgraded from the 6Plus. Transfer was simple and I was able to set the whole thing up myself in less than an hour. My only complaint is I was told if I preordered, I could go into Verizon and trade in my phone to reduce the monthly payment. When I actually went to do it, I was told I could NOT do that, so now I'm stuck with a higher monthly payment than I wanted, and I am NOT happy about that. Ended up using the trade to purchase a birthday gift for my husband, so I guess it's an even trade. I absolutely recommend a good case though, since no matter how durable they claim the glass is, you don't want to take the chance.",5.0
975,Google Shopping,iPhone 8,Absolutely the best one yet. I got in gold and love everything about it. I had the 6s which I was happy with but decided to go ahead and get the 8. Very happy I did. Ended up with 4 in the household,5.0
976,Google Shopping,iPhone 8,"I recently upgraded from an iPhone 6s Plus because I wanted a smaller phone with a little more space. I’m not the biggest fan of phablet sized phones personally. Everything on the 8 is super quick as expected, simple, and am loving the new features and glass-design (doesn’t slip out of your hands as easily). Wireless charging is a huge perk for me as well. If you have a 5, 6 or 6s then the 8 is a great upgrade. If you have the 7, don’t waste your money. Overall, it’s an excellent phone.",5.0
977,Google Shopping,iPhone 8,"I upgraded from the iPhone 7 128 GB to the the 8 256 GB. So far I am loving iOS 11 and how fast the 8 is compare to the 7. I debated between the 8 and 10, but so far I like the new look of the 8 with the glass body. Overall I am very happy with my iPhone 8.",5.0
0,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"I have used iPhones since VZW started supporting them with the iPhone 4. Later upgraded to a 5S, then a 6 Plus. They continued to get better and better. The Plus increase in size was welcomed, but with a durable case became too bulky to comfortably fit it in your pocket. The iPhone X FaceID when initially announced was not a reason to upgrade, however the accuracy, performance, and form factor make up for a great phone. Perfect size and excellent performance and features.",5.0

8,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"For the first time in my life Im actually entertaining Galaxy phones. The problem I have with the X is there is no Finger Print anymore. Im always on the go, I usually wear sunglasses and this affects the face recognition.So I have to stop, stair at screen then swipe or if fails , type in 6 digit code. The display is dull and generally I think my 6S Plus was more robust with clarity. The speakers are really good and the camera is well, B- or so. Video quality for youtubers might be ok as well. But Ive seen videos shot on S8 that are much clearer than my X can take video. The price also is ridiculous and not worth it. after 6 days of owning, Im taking it back and I will gladly pay the restock fee and either go back to my old 6S or try Galaxy S8+.",2.0

16,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"With a bigger screen than the plus models and a smaller footprint. The new iPhone already had a lot going for it, then add wireless charging, face ID, and the new more powerful chip shared with the other models. You come up with the most advanced iPhone the world has seen. It feels good in the hands. A camera that has to be seen in action to fully appreciate the quality, agile transitions between apps, stereo speakers, and the apple eco system that unites all your apple devices all coming together to give you the experience that's worth the upgrade to the iPhone 10. I guess X really does mark the spot.",5.0

83,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"As an iPhone user for many years I can say this version is good as most of the upgrades are, the only thing is that most apps still don’t have support for the faceid and loops themselves sometimes & if your life is attached to having a home button you’re going to crazy the 1st weeks trying to get used to it, so overall is good..: expensive but good",5.0

109,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"I have had at least six iPhones over the years. I upgraded to this phone from the iPhone 7 Plus. I like that the phone is smaller but the display is taller. However, the display is slightly narrower than the display on the 7 Plus. I miss the home button, but I adapted to that change quickly. Face recognition is convenient. I waited a couple of months before buying this phone so the kinks could be worked out. There have been no major glitches, but the phone does not process as quickly as it should.

121,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"Don't get me wrong I am happy with my iphone. It's a beautiful phone but then it needs a case as it is all glass so you never really get to appreciate it's aesthetic beauty much. My absolute favorite thing about it is that the screen is the size of a 7 plus with a body the size of a 7. So I don't need to carry around an enormous phone for the screen size. The battery life is great and the camera takes beautiful photos compared to my 7! I also very much enjoy the facial recognition. My cons, not having a button makes things more difficult, I am constantly taking accidental screenshots while trying to ""wake up"" my phone, also closing apps is so much work now compared to before. The facial recognition only allows it to be set up with one user which to me is a drag as me and my fiance share our phones all the time, and even though we can type in the password, it's just another step backwards. Besides the things I've mentioned I don't see any other major differences between having a 7 and an X. I ended up upgrading after my 7 crashed (which I question now after the whole apple scandal), but if you still have a working 7 or 7 plus. Keep it.",3.0

154,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"Face ID works great and you won’t miss the home button after a few new gestures become second nature. Apple finally made the phone a blonde one thicker to put a battery (actually 2 batteries) in that lasts all day!

Although the phone covers most of the screen, I still find it smaller than the 6s I upgraded from. Facial recognition is a feature I really like. Swiping is talking me a little bit of time to get used to and I like it although it seems cumbersome when you want to fully close out an app. The method requires swiping up and stopping in the middle of the screen, then holding until a red -- appears in the corner of the app. You then have to click on the red -- to close each particular app. Overall, I like the phone but mainly because of the camera quality.",4.0

There were a lot of questions about Face ID, but after using my phone since launch, I can verify that it does work as simply as demonstrated. The feature I love the most however is the battery life. I always felt the Plus iPhones were too large for my pockets and grip, but this one is just right - and b/c of the midway size increase, the battery life with average use lasts me up to 2 days between charges. That means the battery should last twice as long! FYI I replaced my iPhone 6 battery after about 2 years, so this is a great deal. Strongly recommended! Best iPhone yet!!!

295,Google Shopping,iPhone X,Best iPhone ever. I had an iPhone 4s years ago then all Samsung phones. Love this iPhone.,5.0
296,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"So I said I would never pay a thousand dollars for a phone......Well, never say never. I read all there was to read about the iphone X and I knew going in it was very expensive. I had a 6 Plus and it was painfully slow (everyone now knows why) and I was just tired of messing with it. I was in Best Buy (where I get all my phones) and I decided to make the leap. Here are my initial thoughts. Picture is supurb. The phone feels a lot smaller than my 6 Plus even though I know the screen is about the same size, it just feels smaller. Which, I guess is a good thing but I liked the size of my 6 Plus. But I put this phone in a bigger case to make up for that feel I missed with the plus size phone. I know, I'm an ""older"" user so having the convenience of slipping this phone in my pocket is not something I need like most on-the-go younger folks do, I just want to be able to see things on the screen and not feel like I don't have a handle on the phone. So I guess for me, size does matter. The face recognition has worked basically flawlessly for me so far. Its a pretty cool concept that probably needs some tweeking because I do find myself having to do more to get into the phone than I did before. You have to raise the phone to your face so it can identify you then you have to swipe up from the bottom of the phone to get into it. I think if they had a setting that would allow you to open the phone by face ID and not have to swipe to get in, I'd like that a lot better. Having said that, I've never been one of those people that uses a security code to get into my phone and I always worried about losing my phone and someone being able to get right into it. I just hated having to punch in a code each time I wanted to use it. I gave the phone to my wife for her to look at and delighted in the fact that she was totally frustrated that she could not get into it. She kept pointing the phone at me to unlock it and I would look away and it would not unlock. I have to admit, I do like that security feature and not having to punch in a code to get into it is pretty cool to me. I know several others have complained about the fact that now you have to swipe down from the top to get the control center and you have to do a swiping gesture to open up the multiple window function. I guess for me, its no big deal to have to swipe now rather than hit a button. If you grew up using virtually every variation of iphones going back to 2007, you are used to the button. But this one does not have a button and everyone that buys it should know that so why on earth would not having a button be an issue? I don't know, its just different and a lot of people don't like change. Me, I have no problem. I have heard that Apple might be bringing a virtual button back in the next update but all the functionality of the phone works fine for me. Its blazing fast, and that is what I am most happy about. The camera, both video and pictures, works very well. I am a bit of a semi-professional photographer and I will never stop using my DSLR cameras but this phone takes pretty amazing pictures, I have to admit. In fact, I also do some video editing on my Mac and the video images rivaled my 4k Canon 6D. I was really impressed with the video. One more aspect that is greatly improved is the audio of this phone. And I don't necessarily mean quality audio, even though I do think its better, I mean the volume. I use my phone when I get ready in the morning to listen to the watch ESPN app and at times on my 6 plus, the audio was not loud enough to hear when I was running water or something like that. On this phone, I have zero issues hearing it. I'm very impressed with that aspect alone. Its amazing how much sound comes out of this phone. In conclusion, for me, someone who lives in a Mac ecosphere, (Mac computer, iPad's, Apple watch, multiple iPhones and Mac book pro), this device is very familiar. If you've used iPhones for a while in the past, you will have no trouble adapting to the changes that to me, are intuitive because there is no home button. I had no trouble figuring...",4.0

I was not disappointed. While it is true that many of the touted features (face rec, wireless charge, etc) are a nice to have, they have been around for some time now. I, like thousands of others, are disappointed in the lack of a headphone jack but am making due with some bose earbuds I bought with it.

340,Google Shopping,iPhone X,Been excited about this iPhone I upgraded from a 6plus so I definitely was do for an upgrade. I wanted a whole different iPhone than all the previous ones they all pretty much look the same to me. So like I said I went from a plus to this n I must say even though the screen is bigger on this new iPhone I liked the screen on the plus it’s wider n when texting the keyboard ain’t as crammed. Another thing is the whole swipe is totally different then regular iPhones. I hate the whole closing of apps seemed easier to do on other iPhones. Plus had to YouTube how to screen shot since there’s no button. It’s a whole learning experience. I miss my plus,4.0

398,Google Shopping,iPhone X,Another great iPhone from Apple. This time however there are some flaws that I’ve found. Face ID. Takes time getting used to. And not always consistent as Touch ID. iOS 11. Everything done on this phone is gesture based. No home button. This really takes some time to get used to. Also iOS 11 is plagued by bugs that really deter the experience. That’s why I left 4 stars honeslty. iOS 11 is a clunky mess that needs lots of work and can hinder the experience of this great phone.,4.0

406,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"Im honestly not very impressed with this phone. I was under the impression Apple was designing this phone with the ability to essentially be used as a computer, with connectivity to a keyboard and display. This is not a feature I would use often or is of great importance, but it is innovation and could help support the price of this. Additionally, why make this in all glass? (Aside from the fact that it will boost accessory sales as well as repair revenue). This phone still acts glitchy and I got the unlocked version with 256GB memorory. The unlocked version has 4GB of RAM vs the traditional iPhone X models (Carrier Specifict Models). You can research this to confirm if you doubt this is correct. I am at the point where I might just return the phone and either choose another alternative such as the Google2 phone or the BlackBerry KeyOne.

474,Google Shopping,iPhone X,Bought the iPhone X for the camera since it's rated #2 by DXO Mark. I was hella disappointed when there's barely light in the room and the flash kicks in. It ruins the pictures with red eyes. That for me was enough not to keep it. Very disappointed,4.0
475,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"This phone is absolutely amazing with an amazing camera. The detail is perfect. I upgraded my phone in time for a trip to Iceland and was beyond impressed by the pictures. The phone is very user friendly as usual and the extras like facial recognition are a nice added feature.

478,Google Shopping,iPhone X,Good product but after using it for a week I returned it due to the lack of a home button and the multi-step process to close apps. Probably needs some tweaks to the software before I would reconsider. Much happier with my IPhone 8+.,3.0

482,Google Shopping,iPhone X,IPhone X so much better than the IPhone 5. Facial Recognition is so cool and the new screen size from edge to edge is perfect.

I hated going to the AT&T store but Best Buy was great!,5.0
483,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"I must admit, I am that guy that gets each new iPhone. They string me in every time! So being someone that has been through every version, I can honestly say this is my favorite iteration of the phone, ever. This is by far, the best iPhone! It’s fast, the screen is beautiful, and the facial recognition works amazingly. Many complain about that small bump that takes up real estate from the screen. It did bother me at first. After 2 weeks, I don’t seem to notice it anymore. My only complaint is the fingerprint reader unlocked everything faster. I didn’t even need to lift the phone. The facial recognition does work great, but you have to have your face right in front of it. I cant really consider that a flaw, seeing as that is what the phone intends to do. Overall, the phone is worth the money!",4.0

489,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"I was skeptical about the lack of Home button and while it took me some time to get used to it, it is very easy to use. It makes the phone extremely seamless. At first, I thought Face ID wasn’t very accurate. It would not recognize me if my hair was pulled back or if i had glasses on. It learns your face. The more you use it, the more accurate it becomes. It even recognizes me in the dark. The camera is out of this world. Absolutely love it.",5.0

Yes, Android folks are going to say we had a lot of it first, but I find iPhones are a lot simpler and user friendly when you’re not a computer genius that likes to jailbreak everything.

591,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"I decided to get this phone because of the screen size. I am starting to get a little older so a larger screen is easier to read. I previously had an iPhone 6S. I could bring myself to get a plus because the phone itself was too big. This phone is a good size and the screen is great. I do think if you haven't learned to use reachability on an iPhone you need to research it. It is so helpful and surprised on this phone it is off by default. So no home button after all these years. It did take a little time getting use to the new gestures to get around on the phone and do the things that in the past you did with the home button. Once you learn those, you will never miss the home button again. I find doing things on this phone with out the home button seams more natural then it did with the home button. Faceid seems to work great. Just like with the finger print reader there are times it doesn't unlock, but not very often. It is so fast you unlock the phone without even thinking about the faceid part. Just swipe up and you are in. I am not going to get into the camera. It is a great camera, but I am no expert to say how good it is. It takes good pictures for what I do.",5.0

621,Google Shopping,iPhone X,Purchased for my daughter and she loves it. Of course it’s a new phone so it’s the greatest thing ever,5.0
622,Google Shopping,iPhone X,Pros: Face ID works well and is convenient. Full face screen is a very clean look. Resolution/Clarity/Color all beautiful. Speakers at both ends of the phone make noticeably better sound when watching video. Operating without a home button does not take long to get used to. Cons: Still photos are less impressive than expected. Do not match the photos of the Samsung Note8. Very easy to take accidental screenshots.,4.0

631,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"its very slippery & heavy & thick, theres a learning curve its hard to get use to no home physicall button.. face id is ok also hard to get use to altho the screen is full its not bigger just has more free finger space. they eliminated the alarm clock icon and bluetooth indicator its on the control panel screen and no more battery percentage % either. wtf? its also a two handed phone not good for teens with small hands .. the glass back and silver buttons are beautiful but will be covered by a non slip case. the glass back seems to be scratch proof however the phone wont sit flat due to the camera lens... setup is amazing and the x will communicate with your old phone just by placing them together wirelessly.... my favorie iphone is the 7 the x is good... 4 stars not 5",4.0

656,Google Shopping,iPhone X,It’s to small and no option for a larger screen. Coming from a 6s plus to this and wish I had just kept my 6s plus. The facial recognition works okay. Except when power is low. Haven’t noticed any other features being anything worth having.,3.0

659,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"Upgraded from a 3.5 year old iPhone 6. The best thing about this phone is that its overall size is barely larger than my old 6 yet the screen is about 95% the size of my wife's 8+. Larger screen, small package. Face ID is nearly instantaneous. I thought it was a gimmick at first but now that I'm used to it, I don't even think about it. Just pick the phone up, swipe up, and I'm in. I have a 7 for work and when I pick it up, I realize how much I love not having to ever fiddle with the home button--for anything, ever with the X. Screen is amazing. Camera is amazing. I will likely be with this thing for another 3.5 years and I'm fine with that.",5.0

662,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"It was hard to choke down the price tag, but bumping up from the 5s to the X was a great choice. The camera on this phone is amazing! That alone is worth the price.

663,Google Shopping,iPhone X,The new X is very aesthetically pleasing. The pictures and videos it takes are very high quality and the full-frontal screen makes is very nice. It is very fast compared to my old iPhone (iPhone 6). We’ll see if it stays fast once the new iPhone comes out...,5.0

667,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"It took me a while to decide if I wanted the IphoneX or the 8plus. A friend of mind explained it this way.. If you like shiny new things and do not mind paying the price for the X then go with that if you want the same phone as your 7 but newer and a bit more updated then go with the 8 plus. Well I like shiny new things and the newest techy things available so I went with the X. I love the camera, the clear crisp pictures it takes. The face recognition is very cool there are other features that I am expressed with as well oh the battery life I find last longer than the Iphone 7 I had. Overall I am very happy so far.",5.0
668,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"Like all the other iPhones that I've owned, this phone functions perfectly. I've even got used to working without a home button fairly quickly. My only negative opinion at this time is the missing zoom for texting and the icons on the home page. That was a great feature on my other iPhones and can't think of a good reason why this feature was discontinued on the iPhone X.",4.0
669,Google Shopping,iPhone X,Love the phone and it’s upgrades however it is so fragile and difficult to find a minimalist drip proof cover to cover all of the front screen including over the raised glass (fragile) to meet where the screen saver ends. I don’t know why Apple chose to design it this way. Also as it is made of glass on front and back I would think more of the aforementioned cases would be available but they are not. I used to love Tech 21 but they don’t fit bc of the front screen design. Also it is so small I have difficulty locating it esp in my purse after using my Uphone 6SPlus and I wish they offered it in the Rose Gold color.,4.0
670,Google Shopping,iPhone X,It is hard getting use to the New IPhone and it’s features so many to choose from but now that I have gotten use to them I am absolutely in love with it and if you come right down to it it’s the best IPHONE EVER if you reading this definitely buy it and Apple isn’t playing me to say this I have always had an Android phone and I like them but my Iphone is the best phone I have ever had !!!!!!!,5.0

678,Google Shopping,iPhone X,It’s a pretty phone but way overpriced especially considering you don’t get anything nice like AirPods or a quick charging cable.

I have anxiety and jump when my phone goes off if its at max volume. The change from ""Wednesday"" to ""Wed"" on the calendar app icon is not necessary.

689,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"The phone is larger than all previous iphones, however the screen is more narrow. When I watch landscape video, the screen size expands until it either hits the top and bottom, or the sides, or both (this is normal function), in landscape the video expands until it hits top and bottom and leaves over a 1/2"" of dead screen on each side. this means I am looking at a screen the same size as an old iphone 3 or something. it really really stinks. the narrow screen and resultant small landscape video size is a deal breaker. they can have it back. everyone I show this to is stunned.",1.0

714,Google Shopping,iPhone X,I usually don't write reviews and how this helps someone out. I've had iPhones since the very first one and battery life has always been the biggest issue for me as I use my phone all day for work. But the iPhone X has an incredible battery life.

729,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"At first sight, the well known notch design appears to be highly unattractive. However, once the device is in hand, you begin to notice it less often. The fact that one can hold their smartphone in one hand again without sacrificing screen real estate is fantastic! The new iphone X feels and is premium all around! The new OLED display provides a rich and vibrant viewing experience without emitting overly saturated colors, camera technology is out of this world, speed is completely insane, and the battery life is much better than expected! Sure, the iphone X isn't perfect in every way possible but is indeed a step in a new direction; revolutionary.

The larger screen is amazing!",5.0
734,Google Shopping,iPhone X,This IPhone is great enjoying the easy usage with the facial recognition feature,5.0
735,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"Where do I start? The ten is here and it lives up to its name. The facial recognition feature is a determined leap forward in iPhone security, as surely as the iPhone 5 was with its (then) revolutionary thumb scanner. The elimination of the home button will take some time to adjust to, but adjust you will. The downside of the upswipe to switch from open apps and windows is that to close them becomes a three step process. First the swipe up to view them all, then the depressing of one to prepare some (or all) to close, then finally depressing the red dot close tabs on the corners of the windows. This is at least one step too long, and something I expect the engineers at Apple to rectify in the future. As for the camera, you get what you pay for (in this case, handsomely) from Apple. And, as always, it is nothing short of the current state of the art. The iPhone X has set a new standard in how to deploy pictorial splendor from your pocket. The photos and videos you will record are absolutely breathtaking. This is quite simply the new bar that all other smart phone cameras will be judged by. The portrait mode is in a class by itself. Also included is an updated Clips app that now boasts some augmented reality for your enjoyment. As one would expect, there will come a time when this current incarnation is revealed to be crude and ancient, but for now, it’s quite satisfying. The screen size, is just large enough to take advantage of the superior camera the ten boasts, but still respectful of the constraints of the pockets most of us will be fishing this device in and out from. While the price is extraordinarily steep, it is a worthy successor to Apple’s rich history in setting the standard in smart phones. The X is here. It is a ten.",5.0

747,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"First: the buying process was painful - waited for nearly an hour for anyone to sell me the product. Then, all they tried to do was upsell, trying to talk me into things I didn't want - terrible. As for the iPhone X, I like that the screen covers nearly the entire front of the phone. The cameras are great, and there are some other nice features. On the downside, I would prefer a little smaller overall size - more like the iPhone 7 or 8. Also, the phone gets hot when making a call or other use for more than just a couple minutes. Definitely overpriced but, I still bought 2 just because I wanted the latest model.",4.0

I travel theu the US and the screen does not freeze like people wore claiming. Which was why I waited to upgrade and i travel to places that are -25 degrees. The facial recognition makes it easier to open my phone and you can incorporate it into most apps for ease of use. The camera takes awesome pics and its an all around pretty phone. Big screen enough to watch movies but also compact enough to text with one hand. I Love this phone and it takes care of my personal, financial and work needs. Plus large capacity storage for the size.",5.0

754,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"This is a beautiful phone. It’s not really an issue that there is no home button or headphone jack, as swiping up from the bottom works perfectly to take you home, and Apple includes earbuds that plug into the lightning charger port in case you don’t have wireless headphones. The glass back, front screen with curved sides, and bigger picture all make this a beautiful object, though because it is so incredibly expensive, you will probably want to put it in a case and put on a screen protector, which will compromise its beauty. The camera also takes gorgeous photos.",5.0
755,Google Shopping,iPhone X,Upgraded from the iPhone 7 even though I did not need to but did it anyway: battery is as good as my 7 and it is just an awesome phone. I am very pleased with my purchase even though the price could of been lower but overall- Nice phone,5.0

763,Google Shopping,iPhone X,Love the phone it has great battery life !! Nice and sleek fit!! Face ID is super amazing quick and easy to access the phone. The switching around of the features definitely gives it a level up its still the same iPhone just with a twist it made it fun to relearn the functions of the X. It made the experience new completely. I am taking it for what it is and enjoying it Apple is truly THE BEST,5.0

765,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"I have to say I myself am very impressed with the iPhone. For those coming from anything “plus” yes it will initially feel smaller. But you will quickly find that you fall in love with the speed and easy use of the phone so that you stop noticing the size difference. The screen is the most crisp it has ever been, with a beautiful display. If all else falls just open the camera... apple has truly outdone itself with the best camera to ever hit a apple device.",5.0
766,Google Shopping,iPhone X,The screen is awesome. Love that it’s the same size screen as the 8s Plus but the phone itself is the size of the 8s. the pictures are super clear and crisp.

776,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"Having owned several smart phones starting with android. I made the move over to the apple ecosystem several years ago starting with the iPhone 5s and have had a few hand sets 6s and se. I love how everything about iPhone just works. There was no looking for alternative apps or tweaking a setting to get things to function. With this phone I already knew it was great looking, but what I’m amazed at is how great and intuitive it really is. The loss of the home button you would think would limit functionality or find yourself missing the center piece of apples iOS hardware ui. This is not the case I find on my other idevices I try to use the touch only interface of the iPhone X. Tap to wake, swipe up to go home, or swipe on the charm bar to seamlessly switch between apps it’s great. Battery life is stellar especially with the stock all black apple wallpaper, thanks to the new oled display. FaceID works quickly and accurately, and I love that notifications on the lock screen are in private mode until I look at them. Just a great user experience and why I rely on the apple eco system of devices. Display ????? Battery ????? Camera????? Speed?????",5.0
777,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"Same old iPhone like usual, nothing really new but a much higher price. I do love the screen and how it’s fully fulfilled. I love the camera and the Face ID works flawlessly. It’s very responsive and it’s definitely worth the extra money for it.",5.0

789,Google Shopping,iPhone X,I love this phone. The size is the perfect balance for someone who loves the bigger look but enjoys the slightly smaller size. The interface is surprising easy to learn adjust to. The camera is an amazing upgrade! I love using all the different features to enhance the photos of my family.,5.0
790,Google Shopping,iPhone X,Face detection vs finger print reader isn’t even close. It feels like the product was rushed to bring to market without a home button. Lots of things are good about the phone but LOTS of bad. Screen is great however the gestures could be a lot better. The phone feels like it questions what you want it to do. Flipping between apps takes more time. Unlocking your phone when you’re not looking right at it isn’t great.,3.0
791,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"Highly recommend the “X” ... it takes some getting use to without the home button, but the learning curve if you’re an avid iPhone user is fairly quick. Processor is super fast. Camera’s photo quality, as expected, is somewhat disappointing.",5.0

793,Google Shopping,iPhone X,What can one say about a beautiful phone? I am a die hard iPhone fan and I have been in the AT&T “next” program for a couple years now and when this phone came along I of course jumped at it! I love the new screen real estate and it’s smaller size overall..( my previous phone was the iPhone 7plus) which was a bit too big! This phone is also faster and has loads of useful features! The only complaint I have is that a few of the hidden features are not explained....for example...if you have the phone in your hand and it rings ...the volume drops really low...almost to the point of being a “whisper”...I thought the phone was defective so I made the AT&T person prepare a new phone for me only to find out that the new phone did the same thing! (If the phone rings while it is NOT in your hand the volume is as loud as you set it! The idea I guess is that you don’t need it blasting in your ear if you already know it’s ringing! Ibfelt that the sales person should have known this instead of making me spend another hour activating a different phone!,5.0
794,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"After having all of the iphones, Apple did it Right with this one. The Iphone X is wonderful.....great display, easy to use and a great sleek look.

801,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"I have been an Iphone user for 5 years or so. The X is my third Iphone. I love the size of it and my 4 year old LOVES the animated emoji thing. The camera is really good, but doesn't feel much different than the camera on the 8. What is very different is not having a home button. One of the biggest reasons I miss it is that you HAVE to pick up your phone to access the home page. You can't just put your finger on the home button to be recognized. You have to pick it up so your facial recognition will work. One other thing that I don't think any of the engineers thought about - SWIPING UP FOR EVERYTHING CAN CAUSE FOREARM FATIGUE! Think about it, pressing a button with your thumb is a lot easier than moving your hole thumb 1 to 2 inches up 1000 times throughout the day. I have had the phone for 2 weeks or so, but I have noticed that on days I've used the phone a lot that my right forearm is tired. All in all it's a cool phone.

804,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"I went to this from a 6 and no matter what, transfer from one phone to another is never seamless. The biggest thing is no more finger prints! So everything you get into with a fingerprint, you need to remember the password to. I locked myself out of 3 of my accounts. That was a pain, and not every app does facial recognition so be prepared to change passwords, which isn’t a bad thing really. Getting used to swiping everything is easy once you know how and which way to swipe. No home button. But it is easy to forget once you get used to swiping. Battery lasts all day. Big plus. Fast. Bigger plus. I am enjoying getting to know the X.",5.0

808,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"What can I say? State-of-the-art device that leaves the competition in the dust! It’s everything you expect in an iPhone and more. Facial ID is the bomb while screen size is (in my opinion) optimal though smaller than the iPhone 8. I say optimal because at some point in the evolution of smart phones as the screens get progressively larger the device ceases to be a phone and becomes a tablet or mini-laptop. If you want a phone buy an iPhone X. If you want a tablet (or larger) then buy that type device and “enjoy” lugging that around. As for me, the iPhone X is easy to see with unmatched clarity, and is easy to carry on your belt or in your pocket (or anywhere else you desire) without toting some sort of “brick” around with you.",5.0

814,Google Shopping,iPhone X,The phone is amazing. The only thing I don’t like is the way you completely close apps. I like the swipe up method better than the hold down and X out of it.

845,Google Shopping,iPhone X,More hype than substance. While the facial recognition system is nice performance is lacking. Phone connection is not clear. Have many complaints that I can not be heard when calling others compared to my old iPhone 7plus. Despite the hype screen size is underwhelming. Improvement on the top & bottom of screen is ineffective when watching video. Width significantly smaller than iPhone 7+ that impacts reading. (See Photo). Best feature is the camera that allows greater control. Multiple consumer reviews state it is the most breakable phone ever. Finally uying experience was dreadful. Miss days when customer service personal instead of dropped internet connections. Plans that promote free upgrades are worthless when new phones work less effectively than ones they replace.,2.0
846,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"Overall pretty good. Nothing extravagant. If you are accustomed to an iPhone plus, I certainly would not recommend.

Face recognition doesn’t work unless your eyes are open and you are looking at the phone. So it feels more private than with the fingerprint scanner.

I actually just upgraded to a note 8 in November but liked this phone so much that I decided to add a line and get this one. I don’t even touch my note now. Although, it takes me about an hour longer to change my iPhone 10 than It ever did to charge my note. Get the fat charging cube and it will shave some time off of having to wait for a full charge. It’s got a few bugs with compatibility issues, like with he Fitbit, and my gotomeeting call in audio, but other than that I love it. The way to close out of apps is awkward, as well so if they could change that it would be perfect.",5.0

We bought an Iphone 8 at the same time and getting it set up using the home button felt awkward and clunky compared to the X. Also, facial recognition is much more of a big deal than I thought it would be. Just having to look at the camera rather than use a fingerprint is much more convenient. Concerns that I had read about problems with the recognition working at angles or in total darkness turned out to be non-issues. Battery life could be better - a lot better, really - but I'm able to get a full day of heavy use out of it, so it hasn't been that big of an issues for me.

897,Google Shopping,iPhone X,I’ve had an iPhone on and off since 2010. I’ve been the girl who would go back and forth through Samsung and iPhone. And overall I’m sticking with iPhone. I just switch from the note 8 and even though I lived the note 8 I had to go back to apple and get the X ive had this phone for a week and I am very impressed with the phone. The Face ID works great even in very low light. It’s worked about 98% of the time which was about the same for me as Touch ID. Of course when it does work just put in the passcode. The phone fits great in my hand. I like how it’s small like the 8 but the screen is BIGGER than the 8 plus even if it doesn’t seem like it. The cameras are amazing as usual and the Animoji feature is so much fun. I did have a slight problem after the 3 day. The screen went black and took 10 mins to turn back on. I was about to return but I realized it needed an update and it’s been working fin ever since. I do think the price of the phone needs to be lower and it was hyped up a little too much but over all I love it. Ppl wanted a change from apple and now they got it. Just keep in mind that no phone is perfect.,5.0
898,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"I bought the X after having a 6 Plus and have been very happy with it. The size is better, it looks better with glass on the front and the back and the functionality is easy to grasp. One of the aspects I like is the removal of the home button. It used to get fingerprints on it and wouldn’t work so I had to use the passcode which was a pain. Now, I just hold the phone up and it works due to facial recognition. If you are willing to pay the hefty price tag, I highly recommend the iPhone X.",5.0

911,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"Before I bought the IPhone X I read almost every review I could. I saw people complaining about the phone size, the screen size, the durability, and the fact that some apps don’t take up the whole screen. WELL I went from the iPhone 7 Plus and I love the phone being small with the screen being bigger I can still see the same as I did on the 7 pulse but I also don’t have to worry about it not fitting in my hand very well. I’ve already dropped this thing twice and there’s nothing wrong with it at all (I don’t have the glass screen protector and a speck case though. Also most of the apps do fit to my screen perfectly the only one I have seen not is my schools app which makes sense cause they probably aren’t to worried about updating it just for the new phone. I love this phone though very easy to use, really cool features, and the camera is TO DIE FOR.

912,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"So, First before i start my review i think its important to understand that reviews are not the end all be all of products and services, but they do provide sort of a glimpse into certain aspects of what to expect and potentially look for. All in all its up to the consumer to decide whats best for them and what they like. With that being said, ny personal opinion on the Iphone x is that its great!! I have been an Iphone user for close to 10 years now and haven't had any issues with any of them as i have not had any issues with my 10. I have had my phone for a week now and am really enjoying it. What i appreciate most about apple products is the simplicity of use. Apple really simplifies everything and it makes for the most seamless experience when it comes to their devices. Does it always come out with a new feature first? No there are several other devices that have features that apple doesn't have and features that apple has added that have been around for a while i.e. wireless charging and face recognition. Apple gets killed because it doesnt always come out with something first. Thats not a bad thing to not be first all the time. When they do reveal something its again in a more seamless and strategic way they makes it effortless. if you are looking for a quality phone then the iphone is a solid choice.",5.0
913,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"I have been trying the iPhone X for several days, upgrading from my iPhone 6 Plus. While it has some cute features, there is not enough to justify the price tag.

914,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"I can't understand the negative reviews. I have owned every I Phone since their inception. The I Phone X is hands down the best to date. Maneuvering the screen is slightly different but you adjust quickly. The home button is actually an improvement in my opinion. Facial recognition took less then 2 minutes to set up. Additionally facial recognition is quicker and more efficient then the old thumb print on the home button. Battery life, so far, is outstanding. My other I phones I was charging every 12 hours or so based on my usage. My I Phone X is being charged about every 24 hours. A major improvement, although my results may not be typical.

928,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"Apple would have you believe that this is the greatest smartphone ever, with the largest screen of any iPhone. But that's not quite true. Measured diagonally, X has a 5.8"" screen versus the 5.5"" of the 8S. But you have to knock part of that off because the ""horns"" are unusable space in your apps. What you end up with is a screen that is slightly taller than the 8S, but also slightly narrower. You have virtually the same amount of screen. Unfortunately, watching video in full screen leaves a section cut-out on the side or the other option is to center the video, giving you a much smaller viewing area with black bars on all four sides than if you were watching the same video on the 8S. The build of the phone is trumped-up to be ""surgical grade steel"" and ""the hardest glass ever on a phone."" Watch the drop-tests to see how easily the glass breaks and see how slippery the ""surgical grade steel"" is to hold onto. You will definitely want a case for your handset. Break the back of your phone? Apple will charge you over $500 to repair it! While the processors and memory run quite efficiently with IOS (the best feature of an iPhone), IOS itself has become buggier with each iteration. Autocorrect has gone bonkers with IOS 11, autocorrecting words for no apparent reason or changing letters on you. It's great that Apple has ""gotten with the times"" and offers fast charging and wireless charging. Unfortunately, the charger included in the box isn't a fast charger - there is a separate charge for that. Same goes for the Wireless charging. Apple is really pushing AR (augmented reality) as if they invented it. AR has been around for years and is much simpler than VR (virtual reality). You've probably been using AR for years without even realizing that is what it was. Such as apps like Messenger or Snapchat putting hats on your head or making you puke a rainbow. Or hunting Pokémon where you see the Pokémon in the real world through your camera's viewfinder. Yep, that's AR and it's been around. When Apple lets you strap a VR headset to your face and explore get back to me. All in all, the phone is a nice next step from Apple and they are finally getting with the times. But it's not the greatest phone ever made nor the greatest iPhone ever made.",3.0

I Like the simplicity of swiping to open and close apps. The new iOS is an improved change too. The only issue is moving items around in settings. No one should have to google how to as an email account to an iPhone of they already own an iPhone. Nor should you have to open every tab trying to find where that feature has been moved. Overall, I like the X, but I’m still on the fence about keeping my 7+. I’ve got 11 more days before I have to return it. Hopefully the good will outweigh the bad.",3.0

974,Google Shopping,iPhone X,Responding to comments from my earlier post. The iPhone X is just to smal especially if you are used to having the plus model iPhones like I have had. Why spend the extra money for Face ID and Animojis??? The new iPhone 8 and iPhone X have just topped the charts as the most fragile smartphones out!!! And they are by far the most expensive to repair. In my opinion they aren’t worth the extra money. I’m a true Apple fan but the new iPhones have let me down so I will be keeping my iPhone 7 Plus and jumping ship to the Samsung Note 8. I have faith that Apple will do the right thing and make a plus sized iPhone X next year but until then I won’t hold my breath,1.0

978,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"Within an hour of getting my phone and setting it up I saw it. There's a 8mm semi-circular crack in my ""gorilla glass"" screen. I didn't notice it at first until I took the phone outside to play with the new camera (which has so many lens flares that are another issue entirely). With the screen illuminated, it's barely noticeable. A phone Of this level should have higher quality standards. I went to the AT&T store and they said they couldn't help me, to take it back to Apple. This is unacceptable in a new product.",1.0
979,Google Shopping,iPhone X,I love the iPhone X other than it’s size. I am a diabetic and can not see very well. The IPhone 7 Plus with large bold text was perfect for me.

980,Google Shopping,iPhone X,I’ve had every iPhone since 2007 and this iPhone is by far the most overpriced overrated iPhone ever. I used the phone for only an hour before boxing it back up to return. I’ll wait for Apple to come out with a new plus sized iPhone X. Until then I got a Note 8.,1.0
981,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"Calling the iPhone X a “phone” is like calling an automobile a seat. You can sit in a car, but that understates it’s full potential. The iPhone X can make phone calls, but that’s only a feature. The iPhone X provides worldwide access to the 54 integrated services offered by Apple. Anything that I can do with my iMac, MacBook, and iPad, I can do with my iPhone X, but only the iPhone X allows me to do it outdoors in the rain.",5.0
982,Google Shopping,iPhone X,The phone is smaller than my 7 plus but the screen is larger. So far I love it. YouTube videos can been seen full size you just need to swipe the screen from inside out to widen it to full screen. The X is fast and the facial scan works great so far.,5.0
983,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"I am one of those folks upgrading from a plus device (6S plus), so the smaller form factor took some getting used to. The phone is definely narrower but the screen is big and beautiful and to me the size of the phone is perfect. I was mainly concerned that face ID wouldn’t work as well as the finger print reader. It works great! (Makeup, no makeup, glasses on, glasses off, hair up, hair down). It recognizes me and can tell the difference between my daughter and me (we look a lot alike) easily! The phone itself is gorgeous, it’s a shame to cover it up with a case. But it is glass, and I watched all those dropping videos showing how bad they shatter when dropped, so I will definitely use a case. The OLED display is amazing. Colors are definely truer, and black is really really black. I thought the notch would bug me, but it doesn’t.

990,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"After almost two months of using Face ID, it's clear this is one of those innovations that's immediately both intuitive and invisible, and will eventually prove indispensable. It's at it's most convenient when you've got wet fingers, as that would usually result in many failed authentication attempts with Touch ID. However, it's at it's least convenient when wearing the darkest of sunglasses, as authentication fails more often than not (although it's fine with most sunglasses). While on the inconveniences, I've also found that touch-to-wake and raise-to-wake aren't worth the cost to battery life as the phone seems to keep waking while I'm walking around with it in my pocket. This was causing the battery to drain much faster than it should. In order to further optimise battery life I use Smart Invert to convert while backgrounds to black, as the OLED screen should be able to switch off any full-black pixels. Once enabled, triple-pressing the side button toggles it on and off so it's fast to disable it when you need to (it's only moderately ""smart"" so it still inverts the colours in most images). Coming from a 6 Plus, I much prefer the narrower, longer form factor of the X. It's a lot easier to use with one hand. The screen is also noticeably better, particularly viewing photos and videos. However, perhaps the most significant improvement is in the camera. While it struggles in low light, or zooming into long distance, in most situations it takes extremely good photos. Rather than bemoan the loss of the headphone jack, I've taken the opportunity to pair the iPhone X with BeatsX wireless earphones. Similar to the change from Touch ID to Face ID, now it's hard to imagine going back. Overall, the iPhone X is an amazing device. Given how much we rely on our smartphones, to me it's been well worth the investment.",5.0
991,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"Don’t listen to what the tech review site says, this new Apple iPhone X has completely redesign not only what the new standard of edge to edge display should be on a phone but also the new way users interact with their smart phones. Apple sets the standard when they introduce the home button for the first smartphone in the world, and now they are first to introduce no home button for smart phone user interface. The new flow is also so much quicker because we no longer tap on the screen to perform action we now also swipe and slide which means the swipe up to go home is a natural flow. Face ID is also how the fastest way to unlock the phone and performing and ID verification. These two features are what sets this phone apart from the rest of the competitor and no doubt will be the new standard moving forward.",5.0
992,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"Great smartphone by a great company. Can’t help but to acknowledge it is certainly overpriced, especially considering that there is not many essential accessories in the box. Also, sometimes apps freeze and one has to restart the phone. The 5 watt charger that is included is sure underwhelming. The face recognition technology is fairly great though. I would recommend the iPhone X over many other alternatives.",4.0
993,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"The iPhone X definitely meets my expectations. It’s certainly a lot smaller than the 8 plus, but if you think about it the bezels are the size difference between the 8 plus and the X.

Very satisfied with Verizon’s network too, speedy and reliable. Overall I am one very happy satisfied customer!",5.0
994,Google Shopping,iPhone X,Love it and try to ignore how much it cost. Purchased on vacation so sightless cheaper.

995,Google Shopping,iPhone X,So I have had my iPhone X for two months now and I love it.

Maybe i just used to the previous iphone style that there is a home button. Iphone x doesnt have home button but it screen design on top, the curve, for me is not good. I think it is better if the style of the top and bottom is the same. Just straight. I think they maximise the space.",4.0
997,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"I had the iPhone 3, 4, 5 and then 6. I decided that was smart enough for a smart phone and I didn’t need any new phone. Temptation got the better of me and now I have the new iPhone X. Frankly I have no regrets. The new Face ID feature works great and apparently more secure than finger ID. With the Home button missing, it does take a little getting used to, but no more than couple of days. You don’t need to read extensive product manual to make the most of the phone. Just search on YouTube for top 10 iPhone X feature, and you will know most of what you need to know. The battery life is great (I understand it has two batteries packed inside) and the camera is great too. It has one of the fastest processor of any smart phone on the market and the latest OLED screen is really good. Just be careful you don’t drop the phone and crack the screen as it can set you back about $500. Is it value for money? I am not so sure about that. I think it’s a bit too pricey for a smart phone and for that reason I am giving it 4 out of 5 stars.",4.0
998,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"This is the first upgrade that really makes it worh your while. Face ID works flawlessly and the new OLED screen is amazing.

999,Google Shopping,iPhone X,I was really pleased that I held out for the Iphone X. The camera is so much better and the photos look like they have been taken on a DSLR. My only quibbles are the battery life and the price. Hopefully the battery life will be improved with IOS updates.,4.0
1000,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"$1.8K for a phone? I could build a great computer, buy a laptop or go on a great trip with that kind of money. But your are not here for that reason. You want to know whether the phone is worth the money and my answer is No. It's a great phone! but here's the thing, it's not worth the money. You are essentially getting an iPhone 8 plus in a smaller form factor. It's slower to use as the FaceID is still new and it's a 3 step process to unlock you phone instead of the 1 step to unlock with TouchID. Closing apps is a big pain in the but as you have to wait a few seconds to bring up the tabs and the hold again for a few seconds to bring up the close app icon. At least you know you won't turn off you phone accidentally though! it requires 2 buttons :P Screen is nice but viewing angle is not great compared to LCDs. The camera is super great! I love it for both video and photo. The call quality is pretty rubbish, where people on the receiving end hear you like you are living under water. Your mouth actually has to be almost touching the microphone area. Hopefully Apple figures this issue out asap as that's the primary function of the device. P.S. FaceID works with sunnies and in the dark ;) I'd say wait until next year where Apple has covered some R&D costs on the new form factor and lower the price of the new gen iphone.",3.0
1001,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"A great blend of handheld comfort and a big, gorgeous OLED screen. Rear telephoto camera outshoots the 8 Plus in low light, and the front camera snaps impressive portrait selfies. Face ID generally works fine. New interface and no home button mean major adjustments, and key features such as the Control Center are harder to reach and use. It’ll take time for most apps to be optimized for notched screen. The phone is hella expensive, and the all-glass design means a case and an insurance plan are musts.",5.0
1002,Google Shopping,iPhone X,I was unsure if I was going to really buy an iPhone. Been a android user for a couples of years and the system was just slow and cracking all the time. I decided to give it a shot and it turned to be the best decision I could have done.,5.0

I must say, this has definitely been their best so far. Like the saying goes, new brooms sweep well, although the new features and improvements over their previous models is remarkable. The face recognition is fantastic, so much quicker and gets even better with lots of apps adding the feature as time goes. Camera just blows everything out of the water. Even compares to my Nikon D5000 SLR, well almost ;). Always had friends hanging crap about their samsungs having a better camera, and yes they did, until the X came out. At least its now on par or even better in my opinion. One last thing, I hesitated quite a bit moving from a 6plus to this thinking I'll miss the size of screen. Not one bit, this screen is actually larger and the clarity so much better.",5.0

1012,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"Moving on from an iPhone 7, I already had a terrific phone and camera, but it's now gone to my other half. I waited a while for the new iPhone X (pronounced TEN) and I just love my new phone. I decided quite some time ago to travel without a camera, so was keen to move on to the dual lens iPhone X (but didn't want the extra size of a 7+ or 8+). I was initially slightly concerned about the lack of a home key or fingerprint scanner, but needn't have worried. The facial recognition is brilliant and almost instant, except very occasionally with too much back light. (It is certainly far more reliable than the fingerprint scanner. Of course you can still enter your PIN code if there is an issue.) A quick watch of a YouTube video taught me all I needed to know about the new gestures eg: accessing the control centre (diagonal wipe from the top right) - it is very easy to do everything without the home key, and I do not miss it AT ALL. For anyone struggling with it, watch a video and you won't miss the home button- good riddance to it. Some people don't like the ""notch"", (it's there for a reason -camera, face scanner etc) and I couldn't care less. Some people don't like change, if that were the case we'd all still be using the old Nokia Brick phones. The iPhone X is a bit different, but once you're used to it, you should love it, I do. You don't need a home button! (If you don't like change, buy an 8 or 8+, -but you'll be in the minority.) The phone works as it should, is super fast, the camera is brilliant, (LOVE the new portrait mode) I couldn't be happier with it whether photos or video. And if you're after a bit of fun there is always the animojis which are very clever, (but of no real use!)",5.0
1013,Google Shopping,iPhone X,I've only had it a couple of weeks but loving it so far! The oled screen is amazing resolution with crisp display.

1014,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"The screen is really clear and it's easy to get used to the lack of the home button. The Face Recognition ID is brilliant in placed of the fingerprint ID and it's a lot faster than the 6S it replaced.

1025,Google Shopping,iPhone X,I was excited to get my hands on a full screen iPhone. My previous phone was the iPhone 7 Plus. Big difference in terms of size. The iPhone X is as small as the iPhone 7 regular size but is a tad thicker and heavier. Long ago I had the Blackberry Z10 and there's definitely a similarity in the swipe up function. The facial recognition is definitely a gimmick that people will find appealing. But is it really worth paying $1600 AUD?! I've never owned a facial recognition smartphone so yea it's pretty cool to have one. The battery life is between average and below-average. I was expecting the battery to be more impressive. I believe the facial recognition is the cause for using most of the battery life (but I could be wrong).,4.0
1026,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"I purchased my iPhone X from Virgin mobile on a two year contract. I was looking forward to its arrival but was soon disappointed with this phone once I started to use it. The reason I have remained loyal to the Apple iPhone is because I enjoyed its easy and familiar interface since my first iPhone, the iPhone 4 but the iPhone X throws all the familiarities out the window. It’s like they changed things just for the sake of change and had a blatant disregard for the operators usability. The missing home button is painful and to do what was once simple has now become quite complicated, for example closing off apps on the iPhone X the user must slide up from the bottom of the screen, then hold their finger on the app and then close it off like they did with the ancient ios4 system. The reachability feature sucks and is far more complicated then the previous iPhones, the user must swipe from the bottom of the screen to lower the icons. I can only manage to get this right half the time and with the longer screen this feature is more important then ever. Then there is the screen quality, the screen has a yellow tint like it is stuck in permanent night mode. The facial recognition is temperamental and wastes time when it is working out if it is my face staring into the screen. They say the facial recognition lock is faster and more reliable then the fingerprint Touch ID but i found it to be the opposite. Especially because I like to hold my phone at waist height when I use it sitting down. There are some positives with the iPhone X, the battery life exceeded my expectations. The camera quality is great and the new full screen is nice but it’s not enough to keep me loyal. After years of loyalty this will probably be my last iPhone purchase ever. If I wanted to relearn how to use a phone I would have gone out and purchased a a better valued Samsung instead.",3.0

1028,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"The newest iPhone model is exactly what I've always wanted. It's super fast, it's sleek and beautiful. The screen is on another level, and to top it off...

The phone itself is a perfect size and the battery is the longest lasting of any previous iPhone I have had. This might have something to do with the new OLED screen, which is stunning. Without a home button, there are a few new things to get the hang of, but it will happen pretty quickly. This also makes it feel more like a new phone as it's not the same old thing as the predecessors. All in all, I recommend this iPhone as it's an exceptional device.",5.0
1029,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"What a beautiful phone! It's got glass on the back, so it is a bit heavy, but you get used to it after a while. The animated emoji function is really cute, neat and entertaining. The phone has facial recognition, so the phone is quite secure because it detects your face only. The front of the phone is all screen too. It's so nice and a good size. You won't regret purchasing this phone!",5.0
1030,Google Shopping,iPhone X,Best phone I have ever had. The home button may be gone but takes no time to adjust to the new ways and this is from a 53 year old. Face ID works really well even when wearing someone else’s glasses. The OLED screen is a cracker being vibrant and crystal clear. Some competitors may be brighter but then they start looking fake. Battery life is ok and must say that is the only thing that hasn’t improved. Amazes me that a high tech company like Apple can’t do bettter in this regard. Camera takes awesome shots in any conditions. Portrait mode produces great results with a definite wow factor. I also love the wireless charging and the Mophie charger I picked up from Apple works a treat. Can’t wait for the update that will give wireless charging a boost. A bigger screen and only a little bigger than the iPhone 7/8 is a real winner. Much has been said about the notch but must admit don’t even notice it. Dissapointing how expensive the phone is and in particular the way Apple treat Australia where it is even more expensive than the rest of the world. Finally you get flawless and fast performance. Great looking and high quality phone and most probably the best on the market.,5.0
1031,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"Was able to get my new iPhone X from our local Optus store on the 3-November release date. Although it does take some getting used to not having a home button, I love the new full screen! I had the 7 Plus so the X is a bit more sleek to hold which is great, without losing screen size.",5.0

1033,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"Best phone I’ve ever had. Ticks all my boxes, very powerful, amazing camera, looks & feels great. Facial recognition works fast & flawlessly. Best of all it’ll be worth a tidy sum when I sell it in a few years. And the software is top notch. Fantastic innovation from Apple again.",5.0
1034,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"Awesome new phone. It is a little on the expensive side and thats why I'm giving it a 4 out of 5 instead of 5.

It has some nice new features like Animoji which I have already spent hours playing around with.",4.0
1035,Google Shopping,iPhone X,"I have recieved this device early, I like the design, but apps still need optimization for iOS 11. iOS 11 is one of the most unstable OS I have ever seen even with a whole YEAR of development apps crash, OS glitches ad a lot more. The iPhone is good but it is not worth 1.5K. Some apps still need optimization for the top notch.",4.0
0,Influenster,iPhone X,"I was pretty excited to get the phone, but was also hesitant. I was going from a 6S to the X and was worried that it may be too much of a big change for me to get used to with it having no home button.
After having the phone now for over a week, I am happy to say that I have been having a great experience with it so far. I had very little issues with switching to it. No problem at all with Face ID.
The only thing I am not really a fan of is changing to app view and closing the apps out. I find it to be a bit of a time waster compared to how it was with a home button.
One of my favourite features is the camera. I am really liking the quality of the photos, especially those that are taken in Portrait mode.
I am very happy with this phone.",5.0

17,Influenster,iPhone X,"I’m seriously crushing on the new Apple iPhone X.
I would LOVE to get one of these from Santa this year but I think I might be on his naughty list ?
With its Face ID and voice recognition, it’s faster and smarter than it’s predecessors. You can also send an Animoji of yourself in messages, can’t wait to play with that function.....
Edge to edge, corner to corner screen makes it so very appealing to the eye........
Wireless charging would make life so much simpler, no more being tied to the wall........
And with all that screen, you’d expect nothing less than it being dust and water resistant. Which means good things for those miserable English days and nights and when it simply won’t stop raining!!
My crush on the iPhone X is because of all the above reasons, who wouldn’t want a phone that can pretty much do everything?!
Having one of these would make writing reviews and taking pictures and shooting videos so much more of an enjoyable experience.
